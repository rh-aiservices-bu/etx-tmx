It benefits from a growing market with solid fundamentals. The key market drivers are urbanisation, environmental concerns, economic growth, governmental spending and digital transformation.

In this context, Alstom has been able to develop both a local and global presence that sets it apart from many of its competitors, while offering proximity to customers and great industrial flexibility. Its range of solutions, one of the most complete and integrated on the market, and its position as a technological leader, place Alstom in a unique situation to benefit from the worldwide growth in the rail transport market. Lastly, in order to generate profitable growth, Alstom focuses on operational excellence and its product mix evolution.

The  consolidated  financial  statements  are  presented  in  euro  and  have  been  authorised  for  issue  by  the  Board  of Directors  held  on  9  May  2023.  In  accordance  with  French  legislation,  they  will  be  final  once  approved  by  the shareholders of Alstom at the Annual General Meeting convened for 11 July 2023.

## A. MAJOR EVENTS AND CHANGES IN SCOPE OF CONSOLIDATION

## NOTE 1. MAJOR EVENTS AND MAJOR CHANGES IN SCOPE OF CONSOLIDATION

## 1.1. Major events

## 1.1.1. The acquisition of Bombardier Transportation

Alstom acquired Bombardier Transportation on 29 January 2021. Leveraging on its clear Alstom in Motion strategy and its  strong  operational  fundamentals  and  financial  trajectory,  Alstom,  integrating  Bombardier  Transportation, strengthens its leadership in the growing sustainable mobility market by reaching a critical size in all geographies and integrating further solutions and assets to better serve its customers worldwide.

## Anti-trust requirements: closing of the remedies

Alstom completed in 2022/23 all its divestment obligations required by the European Commission for the clearance of the acquisition of Bombardier Transportation.

On 1 July 2022, Alstom concluded the transfer of the Bombardier Transportation's contribution to the joint V300 Zefiro very high-speed train platform to its historical partner Hitachi Rail. This transfer involves passing over the maintenance activities,  the  intellectual  property  rights  and  the  branding.  Alstom  will  henceforth  reduce  its  involvement  in  new contracts for the V300 Zefiro train while completing its scope for existing orders on Rolling Stock.

On 1 August 2022, Alstom completed the  sale of  the  Coradia Polyvalent regional  train platform together with all operations  of  the  Reichshoffen  production  site  in  France  and  the  Talent  3  regional  train  platform  developed  in Hennigsdorf, Germany to CAF. Alstom will carry out its remaining post-sale obligations for Talent 3 and will operate in consortium with CAF to fulfill existing contracts for rolling stock delivery from the Reichshoffen site. Alstom has also committed on certain undertakings to ensure  the  viability of the Reichshoffen site during  a transitional period (in particular through allocation of workload).

For  signalling,  long-term  commitments  required  by  the  European  Commission  on  the  supply  of  certain  signalling onboard units and train control management systems have been addressed.

These transactions complied with all applicable social processes and consultations with employee representative bodies and were subject to regulatory approvals.

The loss arising from these remedies net of costs to sell stood at €(30) million recognized in Other Operating Expenses (see Note 6) associated with a negative impact on Investing cash flow for €(63) million as of 31 March 2023. Following the completion of the sale of the remedies, there are no longer any assets held for sale, nor liabilities related to assets held for sale in the Group Consolidated Financial Statements, as of 31 March 2023 (compared to respectively €173 million and €286 million, as of 31 March 2022).

## 1.1.2. Uncertainties linked to the current economic and political context

The current economic and political context creates uncertainties on business activities (namely inflation, price volatility of  certain  commodities,  energy,  increases  of  interest  rates,  supply  chain  disruptions  or  electronic  components shortage…). Nevertheless, the Group carefully follows and monitors the potential increase in its cost structures (raw materials prices, supply chain and wages inflation), being quite well protected (71% of the backlog being covered by price escalation clauses on global inflation - commodities, energy and labour indexes).

Impairment tests have been performed on goodwill, technology and other intangible assets (see Note 11), with no impairment risks identified  as  of  31  March  2023.  Recognition  of  deferred  tax  assets  has  been  assessed  based  on reasonable estimates and on the information available as at March 2023 (see Note 8).

The  Group  took  into  consideration  the  potential  impacts  due  to  the  specific  context  described  above  in  the  key assumptions as well as in the business plan used for, based on its best reasonable estimates and the visibility available for  its  operations  at  31  March  2023.  Some  enlarged  sensitivity  analyses  were  performed  with  regards  to  the  key assumptions that would not lead to an impairment loss of goodwill as the recoverable amount still exceeds its carrying value.

## 1.2. Scope of consolidation

## SpeedInnov

Through its affiliate SpeedInnov, a joint venture created in 2015 with ADEME, Alstom focused on its 'Very high-speed train  of  the  future'  project,  aiming  to  promote  a  new  generation  of  very  high-speed  trainset  which  will  reduce acquisition and operating costs by at least 20%, optimize the environmental footprint and develop the commercial offer to improve passenger experience. In this context, Alstom subscribed to a capital increase in this joint venture in an amount of €26 million in June 2022 increasing its stake from 75.35% to 75.48% with no change in the consolidation method (Joint control).

## B. ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND USE OF ESTIMATES

## NOTE 2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES

## 2.1. Basis of preparation of the consolidated financial statements

Alstom consolidated financial statements, for the year ended 31 March 2023, are presented in millions of Euros and have been prepared:

-  in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and interpretations published by the  International  Accounting  Standards  Board  (IASB)  and  endorsed  by  the  European  Union  and  whose application was mandatory as at 31 March 2023;
-  using the same accounting policies and measurement methods as at 31 March 2022, with the exceptions of changes required by the enforcement of new standards and interpretations presented here after.

The full set of standards endorsed by the European Union can be consulted at: http://www.efrag.org/Endorsement

## 2.2. New standards and interpretations mandatorily applicable for financial periods beginning on 1 April 2022

Three amendments are applicable at 1 April 2022 and endorsed by European Union:

-  Amendments to IFRS 3 Business Combinations - Reference to the Conceptual Framework;
-  Amendments to IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment - Proceeds before intended Use;
-  Amendments to IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets- Onerous Contracts - Cost of Fulfilling a Contract;
-  Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2018-2020.

All these amendments effective at 1 April 2022 for Alstom have no material impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements.  On  the  specific  Amendments  to  IAS  37,  Alstom's  approach  was  already  aligned  with  amended requirements.

## 2.3. New standards and interpretations not yet mandatorily applicable

New standards and interpretations endorsed by the European Union not yet mandatorily applicable:

-  Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements and IFRS Practice Statement 2: Disclosure of Accounting policies;
-  Amendments  to  IAS  8  Accounting  policies,  Changes  in  Accounting  Estimates  and  Errors:  Definition  of Accounting Estimates;
-  Amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes: Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction.

These 3 amendments will be applicable for annual periods beginning after 1 January 2023.

<!-- image -->

New standards and interpretations not yet approved by the European Union:

-  Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements: Classification of Liabilities as Current or Noncurrent;
-  Amendments to IFRS 16 Leases: Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback.

These 2 amendments will be applicable for annual periods beginning after 1 January 2024.

The potential impacts of all those new pronouncements are currently being analysed.

## 2.4. Use of estimates

The  preparation  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements  in  conformity  with  IFRS  requires  management  to  make various estimates and to use assumptions regarded as realistic and reasonable. These estimates or assumptions could affect the value of the Group's assets, liabilities, equity, net income and contingent assets and liabilities at the closing date. Management reviews estimates on an on-going basis using information currently available. Actual results may differ from those estimates, due to changes in facts and circumstances.

The accounting policies most affected by the use of estimates are the following:

Revenue and margin recognition on construction and long-term service contracts and related provisions

The Group recognises revenue and gross margin on most construction and long-term service contracts fulfilling the requirements for revenue recognition over time, using the percentage of completion method based on cost to cost: revenue is in that case recognized based on the percentage of costs incurred to date divided by the total costs at completion. Moreover, when a project review indicates a negative gross margin, the estimated loss at completion is immediately recognised.

Recognised revenue and margin are based on estimates of total expected contract revenue and cost, which are subject to revisions as the contract progresses. Total expected revenue and cost on a contract reflect management's current best estimate of the probable future benefits and obligations associated with the contract.

Assumptions to calculate present and future obligations take into account current technology as well as the commercial and contractual positions, assessed on a contract-by-contract basis (one performance obligation corresponding in most cases to one contract). The introduction of technologically-advanced products exposes the Group to risks of product failure significantly beyond the terms of standard contractual warranties applicable to suppliers of equipment only.

Obligations on contracts may result in penalties due to late completion of contractual milestones, or unanticipated costs  due to project  modifications, suppliers  or  subcontractors'  failure  to  perform  or  delays  caused by unexpected conditions or events. Warranty obligations are affected by product failure rates, material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting failures.

Although the Group makes individual assessments on contracts on a regular basis, there is a risk that actual costs related to those obligations may exceed initial estimates. Estimates of contract costs and revenues at completion in case of contracts in progress and estimates of provisions in case of completed contracts may then have to be reassessed.

## Estimate of provisions relating to litigations

The Group identifies and analyses on a regular basis current litigations and measures, when necessary, provisions on the basis of its best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date. These estimates take into account information available and different possible outcomes.

## Valuation of deferred tax assets

Management judgment is required to determine the extent to which deferred tax assets can be recognised. Future sources of taxable income and the effects of the Group global income tax strategies are taken into account in making this determination. This assessment is conducted through a detailed review of deferred tax assets by jurisdiction and takes into account past, current and future performance deriving from the existing contracts in the order book, Business Plan, and the length of carry back, carry forwards and expiry periods of net operating losses.

## Measurement of post-employment and other long-term defined employee benefits

The measurement of obligations and assets related to defined benefit plans makes it necessary to use several statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events. These factors include assumptions about the discount rate, the rate of future compensation increases as well as withdrawal and mortality rates. If actuarial assumptions materially differ from actual results, it could result in a significant change in the employee benefit expense recognised in the income statement, actuarial gains and losses recognised in other comprehensive income and prepaid and accrued benefits.

## Valuation of assets

The discounted cash flow model used to determine the recoverable value of the group of cash generating unit to which goodwill is allocated includes a number of inputs including estimates of future cash flows, discount rates and other variables, and then requires significant judgment.

Impairment tests performed on intangible and tangible assets, as well as Right-of-Use related to leased assets are also based on assumptions. Future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results from underlying assets could result in an inability to recover their current carrying value.

## Inventories

Inventories, including work in progress, are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Write-down of inventories are calculated based on an analysis of foreseeable changes in demand, technology or market conditions in order to determine obsolete or excess inventories. If actual market conditions are less favourable than those projected, additional inventory write-downs may be required.

## 2.5. Significant accounting policies

## 2.5.1. Consolidation methods

## Subsidiaries

Subsidiaries are entities over which the Group exercises control.

The Group controls an entity when (i) it has power over this entity, (ii) is exposed to or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with that entity, and (iii) has the ability to use its power over that entity to affect the amount of those returns.

<!-- image -->

Subsidiaries are fully consolidated in the consolidated financial statements from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and deconsolidated from the date that control ceases.

Inter-company balances and transactions are eliminated.

Non-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified in a specific line of the equity named 'Non-controlling interests'. Non-controlling interests consist of the amount of those interests at the date of the original business combination and their share of changes in equity since the date of the combination. In the absence of explicit agreements to the contrary, subsidiaries' losses are systematically allocated between equity holders of the parent and non-controlling  interests  based  on  their  respective  ownership  interests  even  if  this  results  in  the  noncontrolling interests having a deficit balance.

Transactions with non-controlling interests that do not result in loss of control are considered as transactions between shareholders and accounted for in equity.

## Joint arrangements

Joint arrangements are the entities over which the Group has joint control.

The Group jointly controls an entity when decisions relating to the relevant activities of that entity require unanimous consent of the Group and the other parties who share control.

A joint arrangement is classified either as a joint operation or as a joint venture. The classification is based on the rights and  obligations  of  the  parties  to  the  arrangement,  taking  into  consideration  the  structure  and  legal  form  of  the arrangement, the terms agreed by the parties in the contractual arrangement and, when relevant, other facts and circumstances (see also Note 13):

##  Joint operations

Joint operations are entities in which the Group has rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities.

The Group recognises the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses related to its interests in the joint operation. A joint operation may be conducted under a separate vehicle or not.

##  Joint ventures

Joint ventures are entities in which the Group only has rights to the net assets.

Interests in joint ventures are consolidated under the equity method as described in the paragraph below.

## Investments in associates

Associates are entities over which the Group has significant influence. In other words, the Group has the possibility to participate in decisions related to these entities' financial and operating policies without having control (exclusive or joint).

Generally, the existence of significant influence is consistent with a level of voting right held by the Group between 20% and 50%.

If need be, accounting policies of associates will be standardized with the Group accounting policies.

Interests in associates are consolidated under the equity method in the consolidated financial statements as described in the paragraph below.

## Equity method

The Group accounts for its interests in associates and joint ventures under the equity method. Wherever necessary, accounting policies of associates and joint ventures have been changed to ensure consistency with the IFRS framework.

Under the equity method, investments in associates are carried in the consolidated balance sheet at cost, including any goodwill arising and transaction costs. Earn-outs are initially recorded at fair value and adjustments recorded through cost of investment when their payments are probable and can be measured with sufficient reliability.

Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group's share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and

contingent liabilities of the associate or joint venture recognized at the date of acquisition is recognized as goodwill. The goodwill is included within the carrying amount of the investment and is assessed for impairment as part of the investment. In case of an associate or joint venture purchased by stage, the Group uses the cost method to account for changes from non-consolidated investments category to 'Investments in joint ventures and associates'.

Associates and joint ventures are presented in the specific line 'Investments in joint ventures and associates' of the balance sheet, and the Group's share of its associates' profits or losses is recognized in the line 'Share of net income of equity-accounted investments' of the income statement whereas its share of post-acquisition movements in reserves is recognized in reserves.

Losses of an associate or joint  venture in  excess of the Group's interest in that associate or joint venture  are  not recognized, except if the Group has a legal or implicit obligation.

The impairment expense of investments in associates and joint ventures is recorded in the line 'Share of net income of equity-accounted investments' of the income statement.

According to IAS 28, if the financial statements of an associate used in applying the equity method are prepared as of a different date from that of the investor, adjustments shall be made for the effects of significant transactions or events that occur between that date and the date of the investor's financial statements. In any case, the difference between the end of the reporting period of the associate and that of the investor shall be no more than three months.

## 2.5.2. Assets held for sale

Non-current assets held for sale are presented on a separate line of the balance sheet when (i) the Group has made a decision to sell the asset(s) concerned and (ii) the sale is considered to be highly probable. These assets are measured at the lower of net carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.

When the Group is committed to a sale process leading to the loss of control of a subsidiary, all assets and liabilities of that subsidiary are reclassified as held for sale, irrespective of whether the Group retains a residual interest in the entity after sale.

## 2.5.3. Translation of financial statements denominated in currencies other than euro

Functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which a reporting entity operates, which in most cases, corresponds to the local currency. However, some reporting entities may have a functional currency different from local currency when that other currency is used for the entity's main transactions and faithfully reflects its economic environment.

<!-- image -->

Assets and liabilities of entities whose functional currency is other than the euro are translated into euro at closing exchange rate at the end of each reporting period while their income and cash flow statements are translated at the average exchange rate for the period.

The currency  translation  adjustments  resulting  from  the  use  of  different  currency  rates  for  opening  balance  sheet positions, transactions of the period and closing balance sheet positions are recorded in other comprehensive income. Translation adjustments are transferred to the consolidated income statement at the time of the disposal of the related entity.

Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising from the acquisition of entities whose functional currency is not euro are designated  as  assets  and  liabilities  of  those  entities  and  therefore  denominated  in  their  functional  currencies  and translated at the closing rate at the end of each reporting period.

## 2.5.4. Business combinations

Business combinations completed between the 1 January 2004 and the 31 March 2010 have been recognised applying the provisions of the previous version of IFRS 3.

Business combinations completed from the 1 April 2010 onwards are recognised in accordance with IFRS 3R.

The Group applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations. The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the sum of fair values of the assets transferred and the liabilities incurred by the acquirer at the acquisition date and the equity-interest issued by the acquirer. The consideration transferred includes contingent consideration, measured and recognized at fair value at the acquisition date.

For each business combination, any non-controlling interest in the acquiree may be measured:

-  either  at  the  acquisition-date  fair  value,  leading  to  the  recognition  of  the  non-controlling  interest's  share  of goodwill (full goodwill method) or;
-  either at the non-controlling interest's proportionate share of the acquiree's identifiable net assets, resulting in recognition of only the share of goodwill attributable to equity holders of the parent (partial goodwill method).

Acquisition-related costs are recorded as an expense as incurred.

Goodwill arising from a business combination is measured as the difference between:

-  the fair value of the consideration transferred for an acquiree plus the amount of any non-controlling interests of the acquiree and;
-  the net fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date.

Initial estimates of consideration transferred and fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are finalised within twelve months after the date of acquisition and any adjustments are accounted for as retroactive adjustments to goodwill. Beyond this twelve-month period, any adjustment is directly recognised in the income statement.

Earn-outs are initially recorded at fair value and adjustments made beyond the twelve-month measurement period following the acquisition are systematically recognised through profit or loss.

In case of a step-acquisition that leads to the Group acquiring control of the acquiree, the equity interest previously held by the Group is remeasured at its acquisition-date fair value and any resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss.

## 2.5.5. Sales and costs generated by operating activities

## Identification of performance obligations

Most contracts with customers do not contain more than a single performance obligation. Only a contract which is executed in two stages starting with the supply of goods to a customer followed by services performed on the assets built  (maintenance)  include  two  distinct  performance  obligations.  The  transaction  price  is  allocated  among  the performance obligations in proportion to the stand-alone selling prices of goods and services.

Contracts may provide customers with the option to acquire additional goods or services. Additional goods sold in the frame of an option subsequently exercised or through a contract modification are accounted on a cumulative catch-up basis with the first goods sold and treated, accordingly, as a single performance obligation.

Maintenance contract renewals are accounted for separately from the initial contract.

Service-type warranties are recognised as distinct performance obligations.

## Measurement of sales and costs

The  amount  of  revenue  arising  from  a  transaction  is  usually  determined  by  the  contractual  agreement  with  the customer.  IFRS  15  provides  restrictive  guidance  on  the  transaction  price  estimates  and  especially  on  variable consideration and contract modifications.

The estimation of the transaction price should include variable amounts and/or contract modifications to the extent that it is highly probable that no significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenues recognized will occur when the uncertainty associated with these elements is subsequently resolved. The introduction of this constraint on the price escalation estimates on the one hand, as well as the incorporation of amendments under negotiation on the other hand, leads to recognize these effects on contract value at a later point in time, when they become enforceable.

In the case of 'construction contracts' claims are considered in the determination of contract revenue only when it is highly probable that the claim will result in additional revenue and the amount can be reliably estimated.

Penalties are first taken into account as an increase of contract costs and in a second step as a reduction of contract revenue as soon as they are accepted.

Finally, a significant financial component should be introduced positively or negatively on revenue, when timing of cash receipts and revenue recognition under cost to cost method differ substantially.

Production costs include direct costs (such as material, labour and warranty costs) and indirect costs. Warranty costs are estimated on the basis of contractual agreement, available statistical data and weighting of all possible outcomes against  their  associated  probabilities.  Warranty  periods  may  extend  up  to  five  years.  Selling  and  administrative expenses are excluded from production costs.

## Recognition of sales and costs

Revenue on sale of manufactured products is recognised according to IFRS 15 at a point in time, i.e. essentially when the control of the promised goods is transferred to the customer, which generally occurs on delivery. Revenue on shortterm service contracts is also accounted for at a point in time and recognised on performance of the related service. All production costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the sale are charged to cost of sales at the date of recognition of sales.

Revenue on most of 'construction contracts' and long-term service agreements is recognised according to IFRS 15 based on the percentage of completion method as they fulfill the requirements for revenue recognition over time: the

<!-- image -->

stage of completion is assessed on the cost to cost method. Revenue is recognised for each performance obligation based on the percentage of costs incurred to date divided by the total costs expected at completion. Consequently, the revenue for the period is the excess of revenue measured according to the percentage of completion over the revenue recognised in prior periods.

Cost of sales on «construction contracts» and long-term service agreements is computed on the same basis. The cost of sales for the period is the excess of cost measured according to the percentage of completion over the cost of sales recognised in prior periods. As a consequence, adjustments to contract estimates resulting from work conditions and performance are recognised in cost of sales as soon as they occur, prorated to the stage of completion.

When the outcome of a contract cannot be estimated reliably, but the Group expects to recover the costs incurred in satisfying the contract, revenue is recognised only to the extent of the costs incurred until such time that the outcome of the contract can be reasonably measured.

Costs incurred that are attributable to significant inefficiencies in the Group's performance and that were not reflected in  the  price  of  the  contract  when  the  contract  was  negotiated  with  the  customer  should  not  be  included  in  the percentage of completion formula and expensed when incurred.

When it is probable that contract costs at completion will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss at completion is recognised immediately as an expense. Bid costs are recorded as selling expenses when incurred.

## 2.5.6. Impairment of goodwill, tangible and intangible assets as well as Right-of-Use related to leased assets

Assets  that  have  an  indefinite  useful  life  -  mainly  goodwill  and  intangible  assets  not  yet  ready  to  use  -  are  not amortised. Those assets as well as capitalised R&D are tested for impairment at least annually or when there are indicators that they may be impaired. Other intangible and tangible assets as well as Right-of-Use related to leased assets subject to amortisation are tested for impairment only if there are indicators of impairment.

The impairment test methodology is based on a comparison between the recoverable amount of an asset and its net carrying value. If the recoverable amount of an asset or a cash-generating unit (CGU) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount is reduced to its recoverable amount and the impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement. In the case of goodwill allocated to a group of CGUs, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of goodwill and then to the other assets on a pro-rata basis of the carrying amount of each asset.

A  cash-generating  unit  is  the  smallest  identifiable  group  of  assets  that  generates  cash  inflows  that  are  largely independent of the cash inflows from other groups of assets. If an asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of other assets or groups of assets, the recoverable amount is determined for a cash-generating unit.

The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. The value in use is elected as representative of the recoverable value. The valuation performed is based upon the Group's internal three-year business plan. Cash flows beyond this period are estimated using a perpetual long-term growth rate for the subsequent years. The recoverable amount is the sum of the discounted cash flows and the discounted terminal residual value. Discount rates are determined using the weighted-average cost of capital.

Impairment losses recognised in respect of goodwill cannot be reversed.

The impairment losses recognized in respect of other assets  than goodwill  may  be  reversed in  a later period  and recognized  immediately  in  the  income  statement.  The  carrying  amount  is  increased  to  the  revised  estimate  of

<!-- image -->

recoverable amount, so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, if no impairment loss had been recognized in prior years.

## 2.6. Climate change consequences

The Group has initiated an in-depth analysis of the risks and opportunities related to the consequences of climate change, that could affect its business.

This consideration led the Group to conduct an assessment of the resilience and adaptation of its sites and facilities to identify any physical risk, to which it could be exposed due to climate change. Based on a detailed review carried out by an independent third party, the Group measured its exposure to potential physical risks on the basis of various global warming scenarios of +1.9° up to +3°C by 2030 - 2050. These scenarios could lead to a potential increase of operating and/or capital expenditure, especially in extreme scenarios. On this basis, the Group has not identified any risk of impairment as of 31 March 2023.

The Group is committed to achieve carbon neutrality in its value chain by 2050. The projects decided and deployed in this trajectory might have an impact on the Group's investment strategy, research and development expenditure or in the valuation of certain long-term assets and liabilities. Also, the Group is integrating more systematically the transition risks and opportunities into the assessment of its financial performance and the valuation of its assets and liabilities. At this stage, none of the projects decided or risks or opportunities identified have led to review accounting judgements or estimates. The group will continuously update and improve its analysis. New projects or elements identified could lead, in the future, to review certain accounting judgments or estimates.

The Group's internal business plan used for the impairment tests takes into account growth assumptions which are consistent with the trends observed in the industry by independent market studies and, confirming a growing demand for smart and green mobility solutions in the next generations of products and services and for alternatives to diesel. These impacts are reflected in the long-term growth rate used by the Group, which has increased this year from 2.5% to 3% (see Note 11). The Group has also set carbon reduction targets for its own operations and supply chain leading to an increase in some operating and investment costs (eg. processes or systems targeting energy efficiency in factories, development of external or in-house supply of green energy), which have been reflected in the cash flow projections.

The commitments made by the Group in the fight against global warming are reflected in the variable compensation targets set for the Group's senior executives and managers as well. The Alstom Short Term Incentive (STI) Scheme relies  on the Group's performance criteria, which have included since 2022/23 a target of reduction in direct and indirect  CO2  emissions  in  the  operations  (Scopes  1  &  2).  24,796  managers  benefit  from  such  annual  variable compensation. The share-based payment plans, set on an annual basis, have included since 2020 a performance condition related to the reduction of energy consumption in the Group's products and services offerings. These plans concern nearly 1,500 beneficiaries. In the latest plan (PSP 2022 - launched in May 2022), this criterion stood for 15% of the shares allocation (see Note 30).

Finally,  in  July  2022,  the  Group  extended  its  Committed  Guarantee  Facility  Agreement  ('CGFA')  and  included  an incentive-based  mechanism  linked  to  sustainability  performance  criteria.  The  CGFA  is  used  by  the  Group  for  the issuance of commercial bank guarantees issued for the benefit of its customers in order to guarantee the performance commitments or any contingent liabilities that it may have towards its customers (see Note 32).

To the best of the Group's knowledge and at the stage of completion of the projects in progress, the Group has not identified any significant impact in the preparation of its Consolidated Financial Statements as of 31 March 2023.

## 2.7. Amortisation of Purchase Price Allocation

Since the acquisition of Bombardier Transportation, amortisation expense of assets exclusively acquired in the context of business combinations, and previously recognized in Other Expenses, is now accounted in costs of sales for backlog, product and project as well as customer relationships, in R&D costs for acquired technology, and in share in net income of equity-accounted investment for investments in Joint Ventures and Associates. The PPA amortisation impacting the pre-tax income (meaning cost of sales and R&D costs) amounts to €(416) million at 31 March 2023, compared to €(431) million at 31 March 2022, while the PPA amortisation impacting the share in net income of equity-accounted investment amounts to €(11) million at 31 March 2023, compared to €(13) million at 31 March 2022.

In addition to 2022/23 expected amortisation plan amounting to €(416) million, an impairment of tangible assets of €(29) million linked to restructuring plan in Germany has been recognized in the Other income/ (expense) line (see Note 6).

## C. SEGMENT INFORMATION

## NOTE 3. SEGMENT INFORMATION

The Group financial information is reviewed through multiple axes of analysis (regions, sites, contracts, functions, products) reflective of the whole organization and the integrated manufacturing process and nature of its products and services, in particular turnkey solutions. None of these axes taken individually allows for a full comprehensive analysis of the operating profit nor a segmental information in the balance sheet.

The segment information issued to the Alstom Executive Committee, identified as the Group's Chief Operating Decisions Maker (CODM) presents Key Performance Indicators at Group level. Strategic decisions and resource allocation are driven based on this reporting. The segment information has been adapted according to a similar method as those used to prepare the consolidated financial statements.

## NOTE 6. OTHER INCOME AND OTHER EXPENSES

Other income and expenses are representative of items which are inherently difficult to predict due to their unusual, irregular or non-recurring nature.

Other income may include capital gains on disposal of investments or activities and capital gains on disposal of tangible and intangible assets arising  from activities disposed or facing restructuring plans, any income associated to past disposals as well as a portion of post-employment and other long-term defined employee benefits (plan amendments, impact  of  curtailments  and  settlements  and  actuarial  gains  on  long-term  benefits  other  than  post-employment benefits).

Other expenses include capital losses on disposal of investments or activities and capital losses on disposal of tangible and intangible assets relating to activities facing restructuring plans as well as any costs associated to past disposals, restructuring costs, rationalisation costs, significant impairment losses on assets, costs incurred to realize business combinations and amortisation expense of assets exclusively acquired in the context of former business combinations (technology, customer relationship, margin in backlog, margin on inventory), litigation costs that have arisen outside the ordinary course of business and a portion of post-employment and other long-term defined benefit expense.

Net financial income/(expenses) on debt is the cost of borrowings net of income from cash and cash equivalents.

As of 31 March 2023, interest income amounts to €10 million, representing mainly the remuneration of the Group's cash  position  over  the  period,  while  interest  expenses  amount  to  €(62)  million  including  €(14)  million  of  interest expenses on lease obligations.

The net cost of foreign exchange hedging of €26 million includes primarily the amortized cost of carry (forward points) of foreign exchange hedging implemented to hedge the exposures in foreign currency arising from commercial contracts and from hedging of intercompany financial positions.

The  net  financial  expense  from  employee  defined  benefit  plans  of  €(26)  million  represents  the  interest  costs  on obligations net of interest income from fund assets calculated using the same discount rate.

The financial component of €(1) million represents the recognition of financial revenue under IFRS15.

Other net financial income/expenses of €(50) million include mainly bank and other fees of which a large part relates to commitment fees paid on guarantee facilities, revolving facilities and fees paid on bonds.

Net Financial income and net financial expenses presentation has been realigned between this note and consolidated income statement of the primary statement for both Fiscal Year ended 31 March 2023 and 31 March 2022 as explained in the accounting principle above.

## NOTE 8. TAXATION

The Group computes taxes in accordance with prevailing tax legislation in the countries where income is taxable.

The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date in the countries where the company's subsidiaries and associates operate and generate taxable income. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.

Temporary differences arising between the carrying amount and the tax base of assets and liabilities, unused tax losses and unused  tax  credits  are  identified  for  each  taxable  entity  (or  each  tax  group  when  applicable).  Corresponding deferred taxes are calculated at the enacted or substantively enacted tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the asset is realised or the liability settled.

Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, unused tax losses and unused tax credits to  the  extent  that  it  is  probable  that  taxable  profits  will  be  available  in  the  future  against  which  the  deductible differences, unused tax losses and unused tax credits can be utilised. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date.

Deferred  tax  liabilities  are  recognised  for  all  taxable  temporary  differences,  with  the  exception  of  certain  taxable temporary differences between the Group's share in the net assets in subsidiaries, joint arrangements and associates and  their  tax  bases.  The  most  common  situation  when  such  exception  applies  relates  to  undistributed  profits  of subsidiaries where distribution to the shareholders would trigger a tax liability: when the Group has determined that profits retained by the subsidiary will not be distributed in the foreseeable future, no deferred tax liability is recognised. Nevertheless, the exception is no more applicable to investments/subsidiaries being disposed since it becomes probable that the temporary difference will reverse in the foreseeable future with the sale of the subsidiaries. Therefore, in this specific case, deferred tax liabilities are recognised.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when both of the following conditions are met:

-  the Group has a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities, and
-  the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority.

Deferred tax is charged or credited to net income, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to other comprehensive income, in which case the deferred tax is classified in other comprehensive income.

The review of the extrapolation of the latest three-year business plan leads to a reasonable assurance on the utilization of net deferred tax assets within a maximum period of 5 years in accordance with the Group's strategy, for an amount of €468 million at the end of March 2023, mainly in the United States of America, in Germany, in France and in the United Kingdom for a total amount of €238 million.

At 31 March 2023, based on the best estimate of operating and taxable results, the net deferred tax assets relating to tax loss carry forwards and deductible temporary differences recognised in the balance sheet in France amount to €44 million out of a total of €644 million. Tax losses can be carried forward indefinitely in France on 50% of taxable income of the year. Part of France revenues are subject to a patent box regime with a reduced tax rate, limiting deferred tax assets recognition.

In the United States of America, the deferred tax assets relating to tax loss carry forwards are recognised for a total amount of €98 million out of a total of €256 million deferred tax assets relating to tax losses carry forwards. From 2018 onwards, the tax losses generated can be carried forward indefinitely.

In  Germany  and  in  the  United  Kingdom,  tax  losses  can  be  carried  forward  indefinitely.  Net  deferred  tax  assets recognized as at 31 March 2023 amount to €96 million out of €788 million deferred tax assets relating to tax losses carry forwards.

Unrecognised deferred tax assets amount to €2,436 million at 31 March 2023 (€2,493 million at 31 March 2022).

Most of these unrecognised deferred taxes are originated from tax losses carried forward (€2,072 million at 31 March 2023 and €2,145 million at 31 March 2022), out of which €1,547 million are not subject to expiry at 31 March 2023 (€1,268 million at 31 March 2022).

## NOTE 9. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

A discontinued operation is a component of an entity that either has been disposed of, or is classified as held for sale, and:

-  represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations;
-  is  part  of  a  single  co-ordinated  plan  to  dispose  of  a  separate  major  line  of  business  or  geographical  area  of operations; or
-  is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale.

<!-- image -->

The results and cash flows of discontinued operations are presented on a separate line in the consolidated income statement and statement of cash flows for each period. The Group decides whether a discontinued operation represents a major line of business or geographical area of operations based on both qualitative criteria (technology, market, products, geographic region) and quantitative criteria (revenue, earnings, cash flows, assets). If the assets held by a discontinued operation are classified as held for sale they are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.

In compliance with IFRS 5, the Group applies the following specific measurements which impact the consolidated financial statements:

-  Discontinued operations (including non-current assets, current assets and the related liabilities classified as held for sale), as a whole, are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell;
-  Consequently, goodwill, tangible and intangible assets are no longer reviewed for impairment;
-  The exception of IAS 12 consisting in not recognising mechanical deferred taxes resulting from the difference between tax and consolidated values of the investments/subsidiaries being disposed is no more applicable since it becomes  probable  that  the  temporary  difference  will  reverse  in  the  foreseeable  future  with  the  sale  of  the subsidiaries. Thus, deferred tax liabilities are recognised with an income statement impact presented within the 'Net profit from discontinued operations';
-  Amortisation on non-current assets classified as 'assets held for sale' ceases at the date of IFRS 5 application;
-  Costs  specifically  incurred  in  the  context  of  the  deal  are  presented  in  the  P&L  within  the  'Net  profit  from discontinued operations';
-  All intercompany balance-sheet and income statement positions are eliminated.

## Discontinued Operations

The line 'Net profit from discontinued operations', recognized in the Consolidated Income Statement, includes the reassessment of liabilities related to the disposal of previous activities. Over the fiscal year ended 31 March 2023, Alstom recognized a loss for €(4) million.

Cash flows related to the disposal of previous activities arising from discontinued operations for the fiscal year amounts to €(11) million.

In the context of the General Electric transaction, the release of some conditional and unconditional parent company guarantees formerly issued, mainly by Alstom Holdings SA, to cover obligations of the former Energy affiliates amount of €4 billion. The Group benefits from a general indemnification from General Electric in these matters.

## NOTE 10. EARNINGS PER SHARE

Basic earnings per share are computed by dividing the period net profit (loss) before the financial cost (net of tax) of bonds reimbursable with shares, by the weighted average number of outstanding shares during the period increased by the weighted average number of shares to be issued on reimbursement of bonds reimbursable with shares ('ORA').

Diluted earnings per share are computed by dividing the period net profit (loss) before the financial cost (net of tax) of bonds redeemable into shares, by the weighted average number of outstanding shares during the period adjusted in order to take into consideration all dilutive instruments (ORA, stock options, free shares).

## E. NON-CURRENT ASSETS

## NOTE 11. GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS

Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are reviewed for impairment at least annually and whenever events or circumstances indicate that they might be impaired. Such events or circumstances are related to significant, unfavourable changes that are of a lasting nature and affect either the economic environment (i.e. inflation, geopolitical crises, etc) or the assumptions (i.e. contract execution, procurement, etc). An impairment loss is recognised when the recoverable value of the assets tested becomes lower than their carrying value.

In the Group, goodwill cannot be allocated on a non-arbitrary basis to individual cash-generating units, but only to groups of cash-generating units. As a result, the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes comprises a number of cash-generating units to which the goodwill relates, but to which it cannot be allocated.

Due to the organization and the increasing number of integrated services leading to complete and global turnkey solutions, financial information issued is presented through various axes of analysis (regions, sites, contracts, functions, products). As a result, Free Cash Flow, basis of the impairment tests of goodwill is only relevant at Group level.

Therefore, goodwill acquired in case of business combinations is only monitored and ultimately tested at group level.

## Goodwill impairment test

As of 31 March 2023, Alstom tested the value of goodwill applying valuation methods consistent with previous years. Alstom ensured that the recoverable amount exceeded its carrying value (including goodwill).

## Presentation of key assumptions used for the determination of recoverable amounts

The value in use is determined as the discounted value of future cash flows by using cash flow projections for the next three years consistent with the Group's internal business plan and the extrapolation of the two following years.

The value in use is mainly driven by the terminal value which is particularly sensitive to changes in the assumptions on the discount rate after tax, the long-term growth rate and the terminal value Adjusted EBIT margin (corresponding to the ratio 'aEBIT' over Sales).

Alstom has opted for the inclusion of the share in net income of the equity-accounted investments into the aEBIT when these are considered to be part of the operating activities of the Group (because there are significant operational flows and/or common project execution with these entities). This mainly includes Chinese joint-ventures, namely CASCO, Alstom Sifang (Qingdao) Transportation Ltd, Jiangsu ALSTOM NUG Propulsion System Co. Ltd. (former Bombardier NUG Propulsion) and Changchun Changke Alstom Railway Vehicles Company Ltd.

<!-- image -->

The indicator 'aEBIT' corresponds to Earning Before Interests and Tax adjusted with the following elements:

- -net restructuring expenses (including rationalisation costs);
- -tangibles and intangibles impairment;
- -capital gains or loss/revaluation on investments disposals or controls changes of an entity;
- -any other non-recurring items, such as some costs incurred to realise business combinations and amortisation of an asset exclusively valued in the context of business combination, as well as litigation costs that have arisen outside the ordinary course of business;
- -and including the share in net income of the operational equity-accounted investments.

A non-recurring item is a 'one-off' exceptional item that is not supposed to occur again in following years and that is significant.

The main assumptions used to assess the recoverable amounts of goodwill are as follows:

| Net carrying amount of goodwill at 31 March 2023 (in € million)   | 9,380        |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| Value elected as representative of the recoverable value          | Value in use |
| Number of years over which cash flow estimates are available      | 3 years      |
| Extrapolation period of cash flow estimates                       | 2 years      |
| Long-term growth rate at 31 March 2023                            | 3.0%         |
| Long-term growth rate at 31 March 2022                            | 2.5%         |
| After tax discount rate at 31 March 2023 (*)                      | 9.0%         |
| After tax discount rate at 31 March 2022(*)                       | 8.5%         |

(*) The application of pre-tax discount rates to pre-tax cash flows leads to the same valuation of Group Generating Units.

Discount rate is based on weighted average cost of capital (WACC) which is calculated for the Group based on a riskfree rate and a market risk premium. The current market assessment of the risks specific to Group activity is reflected by taking into account specific peer group information on industry beta, leverage and cost of debt. The parameters for calculating the discount rate are based on external sources of information.

The discount rate has been updated from 8.5% to 9.0% compared to last year as a result of the combination of the increase in the interest rates and a risk premium now integrated in the cash flows thus removed from the WACC.

The increase in long-term grow rate compared to previous year is consistent with the growth rates observed in the industry by independent market studies. This variation is also substantiated by the positive evolution of the Group backlog which provides strong visibility over future revenues.

Sensitivity of the values in use to key assumptions can be presented as follows:

|                         | (in € million)   | (in € million)   |
|-------------------------|------------------|------------------|
| aEBIT Margin            | -25bp  (448)     | +25bp  448       |
| After tax discount rate | -25bp            | +25bp            |
|                         | 920              | (846)            |
| Long-term growth rate   | -10 bp           | +10 bp           |
|                         | (287)            | 296              |

The current economic and political context creates uncertainties on business activities (namely inflation, increase of the price of certain commodities, energy, supply chain disruptions or electronic components shortage…).This led the Group to take those into consideration in the key assumptions as well as in the business plan used for the impairment test performed in the frame of the preparation of the Group's consolidated financial statements, based on its best reasonable estimates and the visibility available for its operations at 31 March 2023.

<!-- image -->

The impairment tests confirmed that the recoverable amount comfortably exceeds its carrying value at 31 March 2023. Some enlarged  sensitivity  analyses  were  performed  with  regards  to  key  assumptions,  that  would  not  change  the conclusions of the impairment test. Namely, a (100) basis point change in the discount rate or in the long-term growth rate  or  in  the  Adjusted  EBIT  margin  (versus  the  usual  sensitivities  disclosed  in  the  table  above)  would  lead  to  a recoverable amount still exceeding its carrying value at 31 March 2023.

## 11.2. Intangible assets

Intangible  assets  include  acquired  intangible  assets  (such  as  technology  and  licensing  agreements)  and  internally generated intangible assets (mainly development costs).

## Acquired intangible assets

Acquired intangible assets are initially measured at cost and amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful  lives.  Useful  lives  can  extend  to  twenty  years  due  to  the  long-term  nature  of  the  underlying  contracts  and activities.  The  amortisation  expense  of  assets  acquired  through  ordinary  transactions  is  recorded  in  cost  of  sales, research and development expenditure, selling or administrative expenses, based on the function of the underlying assets. The amortisation expense of assets exclusively acquired in the context of a business combination is recognized in costs of sales for backlog, product and project as well as customer relationships and in R&D for acquired technology (formerly in other expenses)

## Internally generated intangible assets

Development costs are capitalised if and only if the project they relate to meet the following criteria:

-  The project is clearly defined and its related costs are separately identified and reliably measured;
-  The technical feasibility of the project is demonstrated;
-  The intention exists to complete the project and to use or sell it;
-  Adequate technical and financial resources are available to complete the project;
-  It is probable that the future economic benefits attributable to the project will flow to the Group.

Capitalised  development  costs  are  costs  incurred  directly  attributable  to  the  project  (materials,  services,  fees…), including an appropriate portion of relevant overheads.

Capitalised development costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset. The amortisation charge is reported in research and development expenses.

Intangible assets not yet ready to use (not yet amortised) as well as capitalised R&D are reviewed for impairment individually, at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the intangible assets may not be recoverable. Due to a lack of quoted market prices for intangible assets, their recoverable value is usually determined based on the present value of future cash flows expected through their use or sale. An impairment of intangible assets is booked when the carrying amount exceeds its recoverable value. Other intangibles are subject to amortisation, as a result, they are tested for impairment only if there are indicators of impairment.

## NOTE 12. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment loss. When an item of property, plant and equipment is made up of components with different useful lives, the total cost is allocated between the various components. Components are then separately depreciated.

Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of each component. The useful lives most commonly used are the following:

|                                       | Estimated useful life  in years   |
|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Buildings                             | 7-40                              |
| Machinery and equipment               | 3-25                              |
| Tools, furniture, fixtures and others | 1-10                              |

Useful lives are reviewed on a regular basis and changes in estimates, when relevant, are accounted for on a prospective basis. The depreciation expense is recorded in cost of sales, selling expenses or administrative expenses, based on the function of the underlying assets.

Borrowing costs that are attributable to an asset whose construction period exceeds one year are capitalised as part of the costs of the asset until the asset is substantially ready for use or sale.

When the Group is the lessee, leases (except short-term leases and leases of low-value assets below €5,000 when new, for which rentals payable are charged to profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease) are recognized as a Right-of-Use asset in Property, plant and equipment at the date at which the leased asset is available for use. The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a financing obligation. Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and repayment of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.

The cost of Right-of-Use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognized, initial direct costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received as well as any restoration costs if an obligation is identified. Generally, Right-of-use asset is depreciated over the shorter of the asset's useful life and the lease term on a straight-line basis. Nevertheless, when the lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset to the lessee by the end of the lease term or the cost of the right-of-use asset reflects that the lessee will exercise a purchase option, the lessee shall depreciate the right-of-use asset from the commencement date to the end of the useful life of the underlying asset. Right-of-Use assets may be subject to impairment.

When the Group is the lessor, assets under operating leases, are also included in Property plant and equipment. Lease income from operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.

## 13.1. TMH Limited

Due to the international context around the Ukraine/Russia conflict, Alstom Group did not receive the TMH Limited audited  Financial  Statements,  dated  31  December  2022,  without  any  consequences  in  its  own  Group  Financial Statements because the TMH share in net assets was already fully impaired at 31 March 2022. As a consequence, the summarized financial information (at 100%) presented below are the figures disclosed in the financial statements of TMH Limited at 30 June 2022 and 31 December 2021 and are established in accordance with IFRS. These financial statements, established in Rubles, were converted to euros based on the rates used by the Group at 31 March 2023 and 31 March 2022.

The Currency Translation Adjustment (CTA) recognized directly in equity since the acquisition of TMH Ltd amounts to €(202) million at 31 March 2023.

## NOTE 14. NON-CONSOLIDATED INVESTMENTS

Entities over which the Group has no significant influence or when the value is not material are not consolidated. The Group has expressed intention and ability to hold these Investments on a long term perspective and therefore these investments are considered as non-trading investments. The Group has elected for the portfolio of non-consolidated investments to record the change in fair value on these investments through Other Comprehensive Income with no subsequent recycling in income statement. They are initially measured at their fair value, plus directly attributable transaction costs and subsequently re-measured at fair value.

The fair value of listed securities is the market value at the closing date. A valuation model is used in case of unlisted securities.  Changes  in  fair  value  are  then  directly  recognised  in  other  comprehensive  income  with  no  subsequent recycling in income statement. When the fair value cannot be determined reliably, investments in non-consolidated companies are measured at cost.

Besides, the Group has expressed intention and ability to hold all debt securities to maturity to collect the corresponding contractual cash flows. They are in that purpose measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less any impairment loss recognised to reflect amounts expected not to be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss when there is objective evidence that the asset should be impaired and is measured as the difference between the investment's carrying value and the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition. Impairment losses may be reversed through profit and loss in subsequent periods.

Finally, marketable securities are assets held for trading which cannot be considered as cash and cash equivalents. They are designated as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss. Changes in fair value are reported as financial income or expense.

The Group's equity investment in other investments is not significant on an individual basis and notably comprises investments in companies that hold PPPs (public-private partnerships) agreements or have entered into concession agreements, typically for an ownership lower than 20%.

## NOTE 15. OTHER NON-CURRENT ASSETS

Loans  are  initially  measured  at  their  fair  value,  plus  directly  attributable  transaction  costs  and  are  subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. Deposits are reported as other non-current assets when their initial maturity is more than three months and as cash and cash equivalents in case of demand deposits or when the initial maturity is less than three months.

If there is any indication that those assets may be impaired, they are reviewed for impairment. Any difference between the carrying value and the impaired value (net realisable value) is recorded as a financial expense. The impairment loss can be reversed if the value is recovered in the future. In that case, the reversal of the impairment loss is reported as a financial income.

Certain  long-term  contract  receivables  corresponding  to  incentive  payments  are  classified  as  FV  through  P&L. Subsequent changes in the fair value of such financial instruments are recorded in financial expense (income).

Assets subject to finance leases, are initially recognized at an amount equal to the net investment in the lease and are included in financial non-current assets associated to financial debt. Interest income is recognized over the term of the applicable leases based on the effective interest rate method.

## NOTE 17. INVENTORIES

Raw materials and supplies, work in progress and finished products are stated at the lower of cost, using the weighted average cost method, or net realisable value.

Inventory cost includes direct material and, where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their existing location and condition.

Work in progress refers to costs incurred on product contracts or short term service contracts whose execution will be finalised during a next period. It refers also to costs incurred on «construction contracts» not yet allocated to projects at end of the closing period but transferred to project costs in subsequent periods when the asset becomes sufficiently customized and cannot be readily directed for another use.

Net  realisable  value  is  the  estimated  selling  price  in  the  ordinary  course  of  business,  less  the  estimated  costs  of completion and selling expenses.

## NOTE 18. NET CONTRACT ASSETS/LIABILITIES

Aggregates called 'contract assets' and 'contract liabilities' are disclosed for «construction contracts» and long term service agreements in progress and are determined on a contract-by-contract basis. The aggregate 'contract assets' corresponds to the unbilled part of revenues recognized to date net of the advance payments received from customers. Unbilled part of revenue  corresponds  to  revenue  recognized  to  date  in  excess  of  progress  billings. On the contrary, when progress billings are in excess of revenue recognized to date, the net amount is accounted for

<!-- image -->

as deferred income and aggregated with the related advance payments received from customers under the caption 'contract liabilities'.

The timing of performance differs from the timing when the consideration is received from the customer; this mismatch may turn a contract position from a net liability to a net asset position (or vice versa) during its execution. The Group's policy is to enter into prepayment arrangements with customers and receive advance payments for goods/services to be delivered in future periods.

Some costs incurred in fulfilling a contract that are not falling under the scope of the standards dealing with intangible and tangible assets as well as inventories, should be accounted for under a new caption called 'costs to fulfil a contract' when eligible to capitalization.

IFRS 9 acknowledges the recognition of the credit risk related to financial assets and especially trade receivables, based on the expected loss approach. The recognition model retained for contract assets is the general model that allows to estimate the risk within one year, as long as there is no sign of significant degradation of customer credit risk.

| Net contract Assets/(Liabilities) | (2,248)            | (2,309)            | 61          |

Net contract Assets/(Liabilities) include down payments as well as, in some specific cases, progress payments received in  exchange  of  irrevocable  and  unconditional  payment  undertakings  issued  by  the  customer.  This  transaction  is analyzed as an advance payment received on behalf of the customer under the supply contract and it amounts to €198 million at 31 March 2023 compared to €471 million at 31 March 2022.

## NOTE 19. TRADE RECEIVABLES

A receivable is an entity's right to consideration that is unconditional. A right to consideration is unconditional if only the passage of time is required before payment of that consideration is due. Receivables are initially recognised at fair value, which in most cases approximates the nominal value. If there is any subsequent indication that those assets may be impaired, they are reviewed for impairment. Any difference between the carrying value and the impaired value (net realisable value) is recorded within Earnings Before Interests and Taxes. The impairment loss can be reversed if the value is recovered in the future. In that case, the reversal of the impairment loss is also reported within Earnings Before Interests and Taxes.

IFRS 9 acknowledges the recognition of the credit risk related to financial assets and especially trade receivables, based on the expected loss approach. The recognition model retained for trade receivables is the Simplified Approach 'Lifetime Expected Credit Losses', as long as there is no sign of significant degradation of customer credit risk.

Indeed,  due  to  the  type  of  business  operated  by  the  Group,  past  due  receivables  are  frequently  representative  of outstanding  amounts  confirmed  by  customers  but  whose  payment  is  subject  to  clearance  of  items  raised  during

<!-- image -->

inspection of works. Such receivables do remain fully recoverable; costs to be incurred for the clearance of pending items are included in the determination of the margin at completion of the related contracts.

The Group derecognizes a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire or when it transfers the contractual rights in a transaction under which the control of the financial assets is transferred.

(*)'Other Taxes' increase is mainly due to the alignment of the VAT French law with the European VAT Directive according to which VAT is due on all the invoices made to customers including down payments and progress billings.

Bombardier Transportation negotiated extended payment terms of 210 to 240 days after delivery with certain of its suppliers, that have the possibility to early finance their receivables through a supply chain financing program supported by third parties. Those third parties are not committed, and suppliers have the right to return to original payment terms for future payables upon providing a minimum notice period. The Group considers that the balance of trade payables supported by the supply chain financing program does not have the nature of a financial debt as the extension of the payment terms are not contractually linked to the existence of the supply chain financing program. However, following IFRIC Update issued in December 2020, the Group decided to present the amounts of trade payables supported by the supply chain financing arrangement and exceeding regular payment terms on a dedicated line item of its balance sheet in the other current liabilities.

## NOTE 22. PROVISIONS

As long as a «construction contracts» or a long-term service agreement is in progress, obligations attributable to such a contract are taken into account in the assessment of the margin to be recognised.

Upon completion of the contract, such obligations are recognised as distinct liabilities when they satisfy the following criteria:

-  the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event;
-  it is probable that an outflow of economic resources will be required to settle the obligation; and
-  such outflow can be reliably estimated.

These liabilities are presented as provisions when they are of uncertain timing or amount. When this uncertainty is dispelled, they are presented as trade payables or other current liabilities.

One exception is, in accordance with IAS37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets, the provisions on onerous contracts that are reported in current provisions, as soon as identified. The unavoidable costs to fulfil a contract considered in assessing whether a contract is onerous are all the costs that directly relate to that contract.

Obligations resulting from transactions other than «construction contracts» and long-term service agreements are directly recognised as provisions as soon as the above-mentioned criteria are met. Where the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are measured at their present value.

Restructuring provisions are made when plans to reduce or  close facilities, or  to reduce  the  workforce have been finalised and approved by the Group management and have been announced before the closing date, resulting in an

<!-- image -->

obligation of the Group to third parties. Restructuring costs include employees' severance and termination benefits and estimated facility closing costs. In addition to such provisions, restructuring costs may include asset write-off relating to the restructured activities.

Provisions for warranties relate to estimated costs to be incurred over the residual contractual warranty period on completed contracts.

Provisions for risks on contracts relate to provisions on contract losses and to commercial disputes and operating risks.

In relation to uncertain tax treatments and tax risks, the Group tax filings are subject to audit by tax authorities in most jurisdictions  in  which  the  Group  operates.  These  audits  may  result  in  assessment  of  additional  taxes  that  are subsequently resolved with the authorities or potentially through the courts. The Group believes that it has strong arguments against the questions being raised, that it will pursue all legal remedies to avoid an unfavorable outcome and that it has adequately provided for any risk that could result from those proceedings where it is probable that it will pay some amounts. Following IFRIC 23 application in April 2019, it is reminded that liabilities for uncertainty over income tax  treatments  are  now  presented  as  tax  liabilities  on  the  line  corporate  income  tax  in  the  other  current operating liabilities.

Restructuring provisions mainly derive from the adaptation of the means of production in certain countries, mainly Germany.

Other non-current provisions mainly relate to guarantees delivered or risks in connection with disposals, employee litigations, commercial disputes and environmental obligations.

The management identifies and analyses on a regular basis current litigations and other risks, using its best estimate to assess, when necessary, provisions. These estimates take into account information available and different possible outcomes. Main disputes are described in Note 33.

## G. EQUITY AND DIVIDENDS

## NOTE 23. EQUITY

When managing capital, objectives of the Group are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern so that it can provide returns to shareholders, bring benefits to its other partners and optimise the structure of the capital in order to reduce its cost.

To achieve this, the Group may choose to:

-  adjust the amount of dividends paid to the shareholders;
-  reimburse a portion of capital to the shareholders;
-  issue new shares; or,
-  sell assets in order to scale back its debt.

## 23.1. Movements in share capital

At 31 March 2023, the share capital of Alstom amounts to €2,663,174,178 consisting of 380,453,454 ordinary shares with a par value of €7 each. For the year ended 31 March 2023, the weighted average number of outstanding ordinary shares amounts to 377,849,788 after the effect of all dilutive instruments.

During the period ended 31 March 2023:

-  2,432,331 ordinary shares were issued under dividends;
-  4,236,222 ordinary shares were issued under equity settled share-based payments for We Share Alstom 2023 (See Note 30.2);
-  393,110 ordinary shares were issued under long term incentive plans and 45 ordinary shares were issued under equity settled share-based payments for We Are Alstom 2021.

## 23.2. Currency translation adjustment in shareholders' equity

At 31 March 2023, the currency translation reserve amounts to €(649) million.

The currency translation adjustment, presented within the consolidated statement of comprehensive income for € (200) million, primarily reflects the effect of variations of the US Dollar (€37 million), Chinese Yuan (€(76) million), Swedish Krona (€(60) million), Egyptian Pound (€(35) million), Indian Rupee (€(34) million), South African Rand (€(18) million) against the Euro for the year ended 31 March 2023.

## NOTE 24. DISTRIBUTION OF DIVIDENDS

The Combined Shareholders' Meeting, which took place on 12 July 2022, approved the dividend related to the 2021/22 fiscal year for an amount of €0.25 gross per share, and has decided to offer to each shareholder an option, for payment of such dividend to be made in cash or in new shares. The period to exercise the option ran from 22 July to 22 August 2022 included. At the end of the option period, 2,432,331 new shares were issued at a share price of 21.13 euros and amounted to €51 million.

## NOTE 26. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

Cash equivalents are held to meet short-term cash commitments. To be considered as cash equivalent, an investment must be convertible to a known amount of cash within the coming three months and subject to a negligible risk of change in value, thereby satisfying the requirements of IAS 7.

Cash and cash equivalents include all cash balances, certain term deposit accounts, negotiable debt instruments and monetary UCITS.

Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities on the balance sheet.

| CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENT |                826 |                810 |

In addition to bank open deposits classified as cash for €806 million, the Group invests in cash equivalents:

-  Bank term deposits that can be terminated at any time with less than three months notification period for an amount of €18 million (€154 million at 31 March 2022).
-  Euro money market funds for an amount of €2 million (€2 million at 31 March 2022) qualified as 'monetary' or 'monetary short-term' under the French AMF classification.

## NOTE 27. FINANCIAL DEBT

Bonds  and  interest-bearing  bank  loans  are  initially  recognised  at  fair  value,  less  any  transaction  costs  directly attributable to the issuance of the liability. These financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method.

The lease liability, when Alstom is the lessee, is measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term, discounted using the marginal borrowing rate of the lessee at the lease commencement date if the interest rate is implicit in the lease and cannot be readily determined. Lease payments include fixed payments less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate and amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees. Lease payments also include the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain

to be exercised by the Group and payment of penalties for termination of a lease when the lease term reflects the lessee exercising a termination option. Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and repayment of the lease obligation to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.

(***) Lease obligations include lease obligations on trains and associated equipment for €119 million at 31 March 2023 and €146 million at 31 March 2022 (see Note 15). Non-cash movements for €86 million are linked to lease inceptions, reductions and FX gain/loss.

The financial debt's variation over the period is mainly due to:

-  the reimbursement of €2 million Negotiable European Commercial Papers;
-  €41 million overdraft from subsidiary mainly in France and Germany.

The €154 million external debt in GBP is mainly explained by a €119 million long-term lease scheme of trains, involving London Underground. This lease in GBP is counter-balanced by long-term receivables recognised as non-current assets for the same amount, with the same maturity and denominated in GBP (see Note 15 and above).

## NOTE 28. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT

## 28.1. Financial instruments reported in the financial statements

The Group's financial liabilities encompass borrowings, trade and other payables.

The Group's financial assets include loans, trade and other receivables, other current assets, cash, and cash equivalents.

The Group is exposed to foreign exchange and interest rate volatility risks, credit and liquidity risks.

The main valuation methods applied are as follows:

-  borrowings, when unhedged, are stated at amortised cost, determined by the effective interest rate method;
-  the fair value of the financial debt is estimated based on either quoted market prices for traded instruments or current rates offered to the Group for debt of the same maturity;
-  the fair value of cash, cash equivalents, trade receivables and trade payables is considered equivalent to the carrying value, due to their short maturities, or to the market value in the case of money market funds;
-  the fair value of FX derivative instruments is calculated primarily based on foreign exchange spot and forward rates at 'mid-market' at closing date or alternatively based on relevant yield curves per currency.

<!-- image -->

IFRS 13 application for 'Fair Value Measurement', which requires counterparty risk to be considered in measuring derivative instruments, does not have a material impact on the Group's financial statements.

## 28.2. Currency risk management

Foreign currency transactions are initially recognised by applying to the foreign currency amount the spot exchange rate between the functional currency of the reporting unit and the foreign currency at the date of the transaction. Currency units held assets to be received and liabilities to be paid resulting from those transactions are re-measured at closing exchange rates at the end of each reporting period. Realised exchange gains or losses at date of payment as well as unrealised gains or losses deriving from re-measurement are recorded in the income statement.

Since the Group is exposed to foreign currency volatility, the Group puts in place a significant volume of hedges to cover this exposure. These derivatives are recognised on the balance sheet at their fair value at the closing date. Provided that the relationships between the foreign currency exposure and the related derivatives are qualifying relationships, the Group uses the specific accounting treatment designated as hedge accounting. A relationship qualifies for hedge accounting if, at the inception of the hedge, it is formally designated and documented and if it proves to be highly effective throughout the financial reporting periods for which the hedge was designated.

<!-- image -->

Hedging relationships mainly correspond to fair value hedge which is used to cover the exposure to the risk of a change in the fair value of a financial asset, a financial liability or unrecognised firm commitment. Net investment hedge is applied to minimize the exchange rate risk relating to the net investment in a foreign entity.

Derivatives are recognised and re-measured at fair value. Changes in fair value from period to period are recognised differently depending on whether the instrument is designated for accounting purposes as a fair value hedge, a cash flow hedge or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign entity.

## Fair value hedge

When fair value hedge accounting applies, changes in the fair value of derivatives and changes in the fair value of hedged items are both recognised in the income statement and offset each other up to the gain or loss on the effective portion on the hedging instrument.

Whatever the type of hedge, both the effective and the ineffective portions on the hedging instrument are recognised in the income statement as well as realised and unrealised exchange gains and losses on hedged items and hedging instruments.

As the effective portion on the hedging instrument offsets the difference between the spot rate at inception of the hedge and the  effective spot rate  at  the  outcome of  the  hedge,  sales and costs  resulting from commercial contracts are recognised at the spot rate at inception of the hedge throughout the life of the related commercial contracts, provided that the corresponding hedging relationships keep on qualifying for hedge accounting. For a large Transport project located in South Africa, the hedged firm commitments resulting from the commercial contract are recognised on a forward rate basis. Provided that the corresponding hedging relationship qualifies for hedge accounting, the change in fair value of the hedged items recorded at the project forward rate at inception offsets the change in fair value of the derivatives.

The Group uses export insurance policies to hedge its currency exposure on certain contracts during the open bid period. When commercial contracts are awarded, insurance instruments are settled, and forward contracts are put in place and recorded according to the fair value hedge accounting as described above.

## Cash Flow Hedge

When cash flow hedge applies, the portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective  hedge is recognized in other comprehensive income. The change in fair value of the ineffective portion is recognized in other financial income or expenses.

Gains or losses accumulated under other comprehensive income are taken to the income statement when the hedged cash flows occur.

If a hedge of a forecast transaction subsequently resulting in the recognition of a non-financial asset qualifies for cash flow hedge, then the entity shall reclassify the associated gains and losses that were recognized in other comprehensive income to profit or loss in the same period or periods during which the asset acquired or liability assumed affects profit or loss.

## Hedge of a net investment in a foreign entity

A net investment hedge is used to reduce or eliminate the exchange rate risk relating to the Group's interest in the net assets of a foreign operation. Changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognized in other comprehensive income, allowing a natural offset in the translation differences between the  effective  part  of  the  derivative  and  the  re-measurement  of  the  net  investment.  Gains  and  losses  previously recognized in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss upon the disposal of the foreign entity. The ineffective portion is reported in profit or loss.

## Derivatives relating to financing activity

Whenever possible,  Alstom  Holdings  acts  as  an  in-house  bank  for  its  affiliates  through  cash-pooling  and  loans  / deposits  agreements.  The  intercompany  positions  so  generated  are  hedged  through  foreign  exchange  swaps,  the gain/cost of which is included in net gain/cost of foreign exchange (see Note 7).

Occasionally, the group may enter into a net investment hedge strategy. At 31 March 2023, the change in the fair value of the net investment hedge recognized in equity had a positive impact of 15m€.

At 31 March 2023, net derivatives positions amount to a net asset of €7 million and comprise mainly forward sale contracts of Mexican Peso, Singapore dollar and Swedish krona.

## Derivatives hedging commercial activity

During its operations, the Group is exposed to currency risk arising from tenders submitted in foreign currency, awarded contracts and any future cash out transactions denominated in foreign currency. The main currencies triggering a significant exposure as of 31 March 2023 are the Polish zloty, Chinese yuan, Romanian Leu and Indian rupee.

During the tender period, depending on the probability to obtain the project and on market conditions, the Group may hedge in some cases a portion of its tenders using options or export insurance policies. Once the contract is in force, forward exchange contracts are used to hedge the actual exposure during the life of the contract.

Forward currency contracts are denominated in the same currency as the hedged item. Generally, the tenor of hedging derivatives corresponds to the tenor of the hedged items. However, depending on market conditions, the Group may decide to enter into derivatives with shorter tenors and to roll them subsequently. Finally, in some cases, the Group can derogate from its hedging policy because of the cost of the hedge or absence of efficient market.

The portfolio of operating foreign exchange forward contracts has a weighted maturity around 2 years. However, some forward contracts may mature beyond five years to reflect the long-term nature of some hedged contracts. The Group hedges about forty different currencies with a multitude of crosses depending on which entity of the Group is exposed to the currency. Change in foreign exchange rate is compensated by the revaluation through Income Statement at fair market value of derivatives.

At 31 March 2023, net derivatives amount to a net asset of €15 million. They are summarized as follows:

Most of the hedging instruments are negotiated by Alstom Holdings and are mirrored by hedging agreements between Alstom  Holdings  and  the  exposed  subsidiaries.  Whenever  local  regulations  prohibit  this  intercompany  hedging, instruments are negotiated directly by affiliates with local banks under the supervision of the Group Treasury.

## Overall derivatives positions

Derivative instruments hedging foreign currency risk are recognised at their fair value on the balance sheet as follows:

|                                                       | At 31 March 2023   | At 31 March 2023   | At 31 March 2022   | At 31 March 2022   |
|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| (in € million)                                        | Assets             | Liabilities        | Assets             | Liabilities        |
| Derivatives qualifying for fair value hedge           | 747                | 726                | 502                | 582                |
| Of which derivatives relating to financing activities | 65                 | 58                 | 54                 | 54                 |
| Of which derivatives relating to operating activities | 682                | 668                | 448                | 528                |

Since derivatives have been set up, the change in foreign exchange spot rates, and the relative change in interest rate curves related to the hedged currencies, during the periods ended 31 March 2022 and 31 March 2023 explains the amount of fair value of derivative instruments (either positive or negative). For instruments that qualify for fair value hedge accounting, change in fair value arising from spot rates is mostly offset by the re-measurement of the underlying exposure (either on balance sheet or off-balance sheet).

The  sensitivity  of  the  Group's  pre-tax  income  to  a  change  in  currencies  arising  from  derivative  instruments  not qualifying for hedge accounting is not significant.

With its banking counterparties, Alstom enters into bilateral standard derivatives agreements that generally do not provide a collateralization of derivatives market value.

These agreements generally require the offsetting of receivable and payable amounts in case of default of one of the contracting  parties.  These  derivatives  fall  within  the  scope  of  disclosures  under  IFRS  7  on  compensation  and  are presented in the tables below:

## 28.3. Interest rate risk management

The Group may enter into hedges for the purpose of managing its exposure to interest rate volatility. Derivatives are recognised on the balance sheet at fair value at the closing date. Providing that the relationships between the interest rate exposure and the related derivatives are qualifying relationships, the Group uses the specific accounting treatments designated as hedge accounting. Fair value hedge accounting and cash flow hedge accounting are applied to fixed and floating rate borrowings, respectively.

In the case of fair value hedge relationships, the re-measurement of the fixed rate borrowing is offset in the income statement by the movement in the fair value of the derivative up to the effective portion of hedged risk. In the case of cash flow hedging relationships, the change in fair value of the derivative is recognised directly in other comprehensive income.  Amounts  previously  recognised  directly  in  other  comprehensive  income  are  reclassified  to  the  income statement when the hedged risk impacts the income statement.

At 31 March 2023, the Group keeps short dated floating rate financial assets on its balance sheet, while its debt is merely made of fixed rate bonds and commercial papers.

The Group has not implemented an active interest rate risk management policy. However, under the supervision of the Executive Committee, it may enter into transactions in order to hedge its interest rate risk on a case-by-case basis according to market opportunities.

At 31 March 2022

| (in € million)                   | Fixed rate   | Floating rate   | Total   |
|----------------------------------|--------------|-----------------|---------|
| Financial assets                 | 146          | 1,045           | 1,191   |
| Financial debt bearing interests | (2,683)      | (293)           | (2,976) |
| Total position before hedging    | (2,537)      | 752             | (1,785) |
| Hedging position                 | -            | -               | -       |
| Total position after hedging     | (2,537)      | 752             | (1,785) |

Sensitivity is analysed based on the group's net cash position at 31 March 2023, assuming that it remains constant over one year.

In absence of interest rate derivatives, the effects of increases or decreases in market rates are symmetrical: a rise of 0.1% would increase the net interest income by €1 million while a fall of 0.1% would decrease it by €1 million.

## 28.4. Credit risk management

Credit risk is the risk that counterparty will not meet its payment obligations under financial instrument or commercial contract, leading to a loss. The Group is exposed to credit risk on its operating activities (primarily for trade receivables and for contracts asset) and on its financing activities, including deposits, foreign currency hedging instruments and other financial instruments with banks and financial institutions.

## Risk related to customers

The  financial  assets  that  are  falling  under  the  scope  of  IFRS  9  Customer  credit  risk  are  mainly  concerning  trade receivables  (which  are  at  short  maturity)  as  well  as  contract  assets  under  IFRS  15  (that  have  potentially  longer maturities). The recognition model of the Expected Credit Losses (ECL) retained on these exposures is respectively the Simplified  Approach  'Lifetime  Expected  Credit  Losses'  for  trade  receivables  and  the  general  model  that  allows  to estimate the risk within one year for contract assets, as long as there is no sign of significant degradation of customer credit risk.  The Group believes that the risk of a counterpart failing to perform as contracted, which could have a significant impact on the Group's financial statements or results of operations, is limited because the Group seeks to ensure  that  customers  generally  have  strong  credit  profiles  or  adequate  dedicated  financing  to  meet  their  project obligations or can also be the subject of insurance policies taken out by the Group (see also Note 19). However, this mechanism of protection may become incomplete, uncertain, or ineffective because of the duration of the Group's contract  in  a  changing  environment,  particularly  in  emerging  countries,  leading  to  impairment  losses  determined considering a risk of non-recovery assessed on a case-by case.

## Risk related to other financial assets

In addition to the recovery of assets held for sale, the Group's exposure to credit risk related to other financial assets, especially derivatives, arises from default of the counterpart, with a maximum exposure equal to the carrying amount of those instruments. The financial instruments are taken out with more than 25 different counterparties and the risk is therefore highly diluted, the largest exposure with one single counterparty (rated A-) being limited to €28million.

## 28.5. Liquidity risk management

In addition to its available cash and cash equivalents, amounting to €826 million at 31 March 2023, the Group benefits from strong liquidity with:

-  €1.75 billion short term Revolving Credit Facility maturing in January 2026;
-  €2.5 billion Revolving Credit Facility maturing in January 2028.

Both facilities have a one-year extension option remaining at lenders' discretion and are undrawn at 31 March 2023. Both facilities have been successfully extended by 1 year.

As per its conservative liquidity policy, the €2.5 billion Revolving Credit Facility serves as a back-up of the Group €2.5 billion NEU CP program in place. With these RCF lines (undrawn at 31 March 2023), the €248 million of Negotiable European Commercial Papers outstanding and the €41 million overdraft at 31 March 2023, the Group benefits from a €4.8 billion liquidity available.

## Treasury Centralization

Credit risk from balances with banks and financial institutions is managed by Group treasury in accordance with the Group's policy.

The Group diversifies its cash investments in order to limit its counterparty risk. In addition to short term deposits with tier-one banks, the group invests in euro money market funds qualified as 'monetary' or 'monetary short term' under the AMF classification. Cash investments are reviewed on a regular basis in accordance with Group procedures and in strict compliance with the eligibility criteria set out in IAS 7 and the AMF's recommendations.

The Group's parent company has access to cash held by wholly owned subsidiaries through the payment of dividends or  pursuant  to  intercompany  loan  arrangements.  However  local  constraints  can  delay  or  restrict  this  access. Furthermore, while the Group's parent company has the power to control decisions of subsidiaries of which it is the majority  owner,  its  subsidiaries  are  distinct  legal  entities  and  their  payment  of  dividends  and  granting  of  loans, advances and other payments to the parent company may be subject to legal or contractual restrictions, be contingent upon their earnings or be subject to business or other constraints. These limitations include local financial assistance rules and corporate benefit laws.

The Group's policy is to centralise liquidity of subsidiaries at the parent company's level when possible. Cash available in subsidiaries located in countries with local constraints delaying or restricting the Group's access to this cash was €233 million at 31 March 2023 and €204 million at 31 March 2022.

## Future Cash Flow

The Group's objective is to maintain a strong liquidity, commensurate with the changes in working capital triggered by its long-term activity.

The following tables show the remaining maturities of all financial assets and liabilities held at 31 March 2023 and 31 March 2022.

Planning data for future new assets and liabilities are not reported. Amounts in foreign currency are translated at the closing rate. The variable interest payments are calculated using the last interest rates available at the closing date. Assets and liabilities that can be repaid at any time are always assigned to the earliest possible period.

## 28.6. Commodity risk management

Most of commodities bought by the Group are quickly transformed and included into work-in-progress. As much as possible, the Group includes into customer contracts a customer price adjustment clause, so that the Group has a limited exposure to the variation of commodity prices.

Occasionally, the Group can hedge its exposure with commodity derivatives (copper, aluminum) of which the notional and the market values are not significant at 31 March 2023.

## I. POST-EMPLOYMENT AND OTHER LONG-TERM DEFINED EMPLOYEE BENEFITS AND SHAREBASED PAYMENTS

## NOTE 29. POST-EMPLOYMENT AND OTHER LONG-TERM DEFINED EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

The  Group  provides  its  employees  with  various  types  of  post-employment  benefits,  such  as  pensions,  retirement bonuses and medical care, and other long-term benefits, such as jubilee awards and deferred compensation schemes. The type of benefits offered to individual employees is related to local legal requirements as well as practices of the specific subsidiaries.

The Group's health care plans are generally contributory with participants' contributions adjusted annually.

## Post-employment defined benefit plans

For single employer defined benefit plans, the Group uses the Projected Unit Credit Method to determine the present value of its  obligations  and  the  related  current  and  past service  costs/profits.  This  method  considers  the  actuarial assumptions' best estimates (for example, the expected turnover, the expected future salary increases and the expected mortality).

Most defined benefit pension liabilities are funded through pension funds legally distinct from the entities constituting the Group. Plan assets related to funded plans are invested mainly in equity and debt securities. Other supplemental pension plans sponsored by the Group for certain employees are directly paid by the employer as they become due. Post-employment medical benefit plans are predominantly unfunded.

The Group periodically reviews plan assets and obligations. The effects of any change in actuarial assumptions together with  the  differences  between  forecast  and  actual  experience  are  assessed.  The  Group  recognises  in  other comprehensive income the full amount of any actuarial gains and losses as well as the effect of any asset ceiling.

The estimated cost of providing defined benefits to employees is accrued during the years in which the employees render services. In the income statement, the service cost is included in Earnings Before Interests and Taxes. The past service  cost/profit  and  specific  events  impacts  (e.g.  curtailments  and  settlements)  are  recognised  in  other expense/income.  Net  interest  on  the  net  defined  benefit  liability  (asset)  and  administration  costs  are  included  in financial income (expenses).

## Post-employment defined contribution plans

For defined contribution plans, the Group pays contributions to independently administered funds at a fixed percentage of employees' pay. These contributions are recorded as operating expenses.

## Other long-term employee benefits

The accounting method used when recognising obligations arising from other long-term employee benefits is similar to  the  method  used  for  post-employment  defined  benefits,  except  that  actuarial  gains/losses  are  immediately recognised in full in 'Other income/expenses' in the income statement.

The defined benefit obligation amounting to €(3,467) million as at 31 March 2023 (see Note 29.2) is analysed as follows:

- -several pension plans for €(3,241) million;
- -other post-employment benefits for €(172) million which include mainly end-of-service benefits in France and Italy;
- -other long-term defined benefits for €(53) million which mainly correspond to jubilees in France and Germany.

The reconciliation of funded status of the plans with assets and liabilities recognised in the balance sheet is as follows:

As  detailed  in  this  note,  net  provisions  for  post-employment  benefits  total  €(607)  million,  as  at  31  March  2023, compared with €(852) million, as at 31 March 2022.

The net asset of €316 million related to pension schemes in the United Kingdom and Canada is supported by appropriate refund expectations, as requested by IFRIC 14.

## 29.1. Description of the plans

Post-employment benefits are paid under defined contribution and defined benefit plans. The Group's only obligation under defined contribution plans is to pay fixed contributions into the funding vehicle. The payments are recognised when incurred in the income statement.

Defined  benefit  plans  primarily  relate  to  the  United  Kingdom,  the  United  States  of  America,  Canada,  Germany, Switzerland and France. The specific characteristics (benefit formulas, funding policies and types of assets held) of the plans vary according to the regulations and laws in the country where the employees are located.

In the United Kingdom, there are nine defined benefit pension plans covering different populations. Six of these are Sections of the large UK Railways Pension Scheme and provide a pension in the form of an indexed annuity. In addition there is one post-retirement plan for train passes. All of the Schemes are closed to new hires who are ordinarily offered the opportunity to participate in a defined contribution group pension plan ('GPP'), a group life insurance plan and an income replacement scheme.

In  Canada,  there  are  six  defined  benefit  pension  plans  covering  different  populations  (three  plans  are  subject  to collective bargaining agreements). From 2012 to 2016, five plans were closed to new members. Since 2023, nonunionized employees are no longer required to contribute to the defined contribution component of the plans. The unionized pension plans are based on a flat dollar benefit and the remaining plans are based on the best average earnings. Two unionized pension plans offer indexation per their collective bargaining agreements.

In Germany, the plans provide coverage for pension, death and disability. In the past, the pension was accrued in the form of an annuity. The plans were deeply modified for future accruals in 2010 for the employees to remove most, particularly the higher risk, defined benefit pension plans. The plans continue to be accounted for as defined benefit plans under IAS 19R but with much lower risks for the company. With respect to employee contributions, these are remitted into defined contributions plans. For legacy BT Germany there is one cash balance plan that is open for active employees and new participants. It provides cover for pension, disability or death. The plan was introduced in 2008 old  pension  promises  for  active  employees  were  integrated  as  an  initial  pension  component  (Initialbaustein).  It  is unfunded and entirely employer financed. There are various old defined benefit pension plans, which - with very few exceptions - only apply for vested entitlements and pensioners. All plans are accounted for as defined benefit plans under IAS 19.

In the United States of America, following consolidation and merger initiatives performed at the end of 2022, there is now one major and two minor pension schemes (except for collective agreements) and three post-retirement medical plans. New hires are mainly provided with the enhanced defined contribution pensions under 401(k) schemes.

In France, defined benefit pension plans are mainly end of service benefits provided for under the terms of collective bargaining agreements and Group agreements.

In some countries, these commitments are covered in whole or in part by insurance contracts or pension funds. In this case, the commitments and assets are measured independently.

The fair value of plan assets is deducted from the Group's defined benefit obligation, as estimated using the projected unit credit method, in order to calculate the unfunded obligation to be covered by a provision, or the overfunded right to be recognized as an asset under specific requirements.

In the following tables, the 'Other' zone represents mainly Sweden and Switzerland.

## 29.3. Plan assets

As indicated in Note 29.1, for defined benefit plans, plan assets have been progressively built up by contributions from the employer and the employees, primarily in the United Kingdom, Canada, Germany, Sweden, Switzerland and the United States of America.

An active market price  exists  for  all  plan  assets  except  properties.  Assets  of  each  funded  plan  are  managed  by  a dedicated  investment  committee  in  accordance  with  the  scheme  rules  and  local  regulation.  The  Group  has representatives on these committees and promotes simple and diversified investment strategies.

The  aim  is  to  limit  investment  risks  to  those  necessary  to  fulfil  the  benefit  commitment  (asset  and  liability management). As a result, strategic allocation favours liquid assets and especially long bonds. As at 31 March 2023, plan assets do not include securities issued by the Group.

## 29.5. Assumptions (weighted average rates)

Actuarial valuations of the Group's benefit obligation have been made as at 31 March 2023 and 31 March 2022.

## These valuations include:

-  Assumptions on staff turnover, mortality and salary increases;
-  Assumptions on retirement ages varying from 60 to 65 depending on the country and the applicable laws;
-  Discount rates used to determine the actuarial present value of the projected benefit obligations.

Actuarial assumptions used vary by type of plan and by country.

## Discount rate

In accordance with IAS 19R principles, discount rates are set each year by reference to the market yields on high quality corporate bonds denominated in the relevant currency. In countries where there is no deep market in such bonds, discount rates are set by reference to the yields on government bonds. The required information is sourced from the company's actuarial advisors and from market quotations and indices.

## Rate of compensation increase

Compensation increase assumptions are determined at country level and reviewed centrally.

Assumptions related to the post-employment healthcare obligation

The healthcare trend rate is assumed to be 3.42% in the year ended 31 March 2023 and reduces thereafter to an ultimate rate of 1.35%.

## Sensitivity analysis

A  25  bp  increase  or  decrease  in  the  main  assumptions  would  have  the  following  impacts  on  the  defined  benefit obligation:

## 29.7. Cash flows

In accordance with local practice and regulations, the company pays contributions to the funded schemes it sponsors and benefits to the members of unfunded plans.

Total cash spent for defined benefit plans in the year ended 31 March 2023 amounted to €54 million and covers both regular contributions for accruing service and recovery contributions in case of funding shortfall.

For defined benefit plans, the expected cash outflows are the following:

-  €63 million in the year ending 31 March 2024;
-  €56 million in the year ending 31 March 2025;
-  €59 million in the year ending 31 March 2026.

Total cash spent for defined contribution plans in the year ended 31 March 2023 amounted to €119 million.

## NOTE 30. SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS

The Group issues equity-settled and cash-settled share-based payments to certain employees.

## Equity-settled share-based payments

Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the grant date (excluding the effect of non-marketbased conditions) using the Black-Scholes model or the Monte Carlo model. The cumulative recognised expense is based on the fair value at grant date and on the estimated number of shares that will eventually vest (including the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions). It is recorded in Earnings Before Interests and Taxes throughout the vesting period with a counterpart in equity.

<!-- image -->

At the end of each reporting period, the entity revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest based on the non-market vesting conditions. It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.

## Cash-settled share-based payments

For cash-settled share-based payments, a liability equal to the portion of the goods or services rendered is recognised at the current fair value. The fair value is remeasured at each balance-sheet date and at the date of settlement, with any changes recognised in the income statement.

The Group may also provide employees with the ability to purchase the Group's ordinary shares at a discounted price compared to that of the current market value. In that case, the Group records an expense based on the discount given and its estimate of the shares expected to vest

The plan valuation method follows either a Black & Scholes model (for Special PSP and We Are Alstom) or a Monte Carlo model (for PSP 2020, PSP 2021, PSP 2022 as well as performance shares anticipated). Expenses related to each plan are spread over the vesting period on a linear basis.

The volatility factor applied corresponds to Alstom's volatility quotation for all the plans.

The Group booked a total expense of €48 million for the year ended 31 March 2023 (to be compared to €42 million for the year ended 31 March 2022).

The Board of Directors is committed, in the event of a major change in the Group's strategy or structure, or at the time of implementing new accounting standards to adapting these performance conditions to new issues highlighted for the coming years, both in their nature and in the levels of results to be achieved, while maintaining a high level of demand.

## 30.2. We Share Alstom

The Group launched during the year ended 31 March 2023 an Employee Share Purchase Scheme covering 21 countries allowing employees to purchase Alstom shares with preferred conditions and assorted with a 5-year lock in period, through two formulas:

-  Multiple  formula  at  a  20%  discounted  price  offering  capital  guarantee,  matching  of  50%  of  the  employee's investment and a multiple of the protected average increase of the share during the lock-in period;
-  Classic formula allowing employees to benefit from a 30% discount on the reference price (only in France).

<!-- image -->

The €18 million total expense relating to this scheme recorded in the income statement for the year ended 31 March 2023 has been assessed on the following basis:

-  Number of shares created on 26 March 2023: 4,236,222;
-  20-day share price average: €26.92; Subscription price for the Multiple offer: €21.54 ; Subscription price for the Classic offer: €18.85; risk free interest rate: (2,80%).

In the ordinary course of business, the Group is committed to fulfil various types of obligations arising from customer contracts  (among  which  full  performance  and  warranty  obligations).  Obligations  may  also  arise  from  leases  and regulations in respect of tax, custom duties, environment, health and safety. These obligations may or may not be guaranteed by bonds issued by banks or insurance companies.

As the Group is in a position to control the execution of these obligations, a liability only arises if an obligating event (such as a dispute or a late completion) has occurred and makes it likely that an outflow of resources will occur.

When the liability is considered as only possible but not probable or, when probable, cannot be reliably measured, it is disclosed as a contingent liability.

When the liability is considered as probable and can be reliably measured, the impact on the financial statements is the following:

-  if the additional liability is directly related to the execution of a customer contract in progress, the estimated gross margin  at  completion  of  the  contract  is  reassessed;  the  cumulated  margin  recognised  to  date  based  on  the percentage of completion and the accrual for future contract loss, if any, are adjusted accordingly,
-  if the additional liability is not directly related to a contract in progress, a liability is immediately recognised on the balance sheet.

The contractual obligations of subcontractors towards the Group are of the same nature as those of the Group towards its customers. They may be secured by the same type of guarantees as those provided to the Group's customers.

No contingent asset is disclosed when the likelihood of the obligation of the third party remains remote or possible. A contingent asset is disclosed only when the obligation becomes probable. Any additional income resulting from a third party obligation is taken into account only when it becomes virtually certain.

## Commitments arising from execution of operations not wholly within the control of the Group

Obligations towards third parties may arise from on-going legal proceedings, credit guarantees covering the financial obligations of third parties in cases where the Group is the vendor, and indemnification guarantees issued in connection with disposals of business entities.

In case of legal proceedings, a contingent liability is disclosed when the liability is considered as only possible but not probable, or, when probable, cannot be reliably measured. In case of commitments arising from guarantees issued, contingent liabilities are disclosed as soon as guarantees have been delivered and as long as they have not matured.

A provision is recorded if the obligation is considered as probable and can be reliably measured. Contingent assets arising from legal proceedings or guarantees delivered by third parties are only disclosed when they become probable.

## NOTE 32. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES

## Commercial obligations

Contractual obligations of the Group towards its customers may be guaranteed by bank bonds or insurance bonds. Bank  and  insurance  bonds  may  guarantee  liabilities  already  recorded  on  the  balance  sheet  as  well  as  contingent liabilities.

To issue these bonds, the Group relies on both uncommitted bilateral lines in numerous countries and a €12,7 billion Committed Guarantee Facility Agreement ('CGFA') with sixteen tier one banks allowing issuance until 22 July 2025 of bonds with tenors up to 7 years. This bilateral line contains a change of control clause, which may result in the program being suspended, in the obligation to procure new bonds to replace outstanding bonds or to provide cash collateral.

At 31 March 2023, the total outstanding bonding guarantees related to contracts from continuing operations, issued by banks or insurance companies, amounted to €26.2 billion (€25.8 billion at 31 March 2022). The available amount under the Committed Guarantee Facility Agreement at 31 March 2023 amounts to €5.3 billion (€2.8 billion at 31 March 2022).

## NOTE 33. DISPUTES

## 33.1. Disputes in the Group's ordinary course of business

The Group is engaged in several legal proceedings, mostly contract-related disputes that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. These disputes, often involving claims for contract delays or additional work, are common in the areas in which the Group operates, particularly for large long-term projects. In some cases, the amounts, which may be significant, are claimed against the Group, sometimes jointly with its consortium partners.

In some proceedings the amount claimed is not specified at the beginning of the proceedings. Amounts retained in respect of these  litigations  are  taken  into  account  in  the  estimate  of  margin  at  completion  in  case  of  contracts  in progress or included in provisions and other current liabilities in case of completed contracts when considered as reliable estimates of probable liabilities. Actual costs incurred may exceed the amount of initial estimates because of a number of factors including the inherent uncertainties of the outcome of litigation.

## 33.2. Other Disputes

## Asbestos

Some of the Group's subsidiaries are subject to civil proceedings in relation to the use of asbestos in France essentially as well as in Spain, in the United Kingdom and in the United States of America. In France, these proceedings are initiated by certain employees or former employees suffering from an occupational disease in relation to asbestos with the aim of obtaining a court decision allowing them to obtain a supplementary compensation from the French Social Security funds. In  addition,  employees and former employees of the Group not suffering from an asbestos related occupational  disease  have  started  lawsuits  before  the  French  courts  with  the  aim  of  obtaining  compensation  for damages in relation to their alleged exposure to asbestos, including the specific anxiety damage.

The Group believes that the cases where it may be required to bear the financial consequences of such proceedings do not represent a material exposure. While the outcome of the existing asbestos-related cases cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty, the Group believes that these cases would not have any material adverse effect on its financial condition.

## Alleged anti-competitive activities

## Brazil

In July 2013, the Brazilian Competition Authority ('CADE') raided a number of companies involved in transportation activities in Brazil, including the subsidiaries of Alstom and Bombardier Transportation, following allegations of anticompetitive  practices.  After  a  preliminary  investigation  stage,  CADE  notified  in  March  2014  the  opening  of  an administrative  procedure  against  several  companies,  of  which  the  Alstom's  and  Bombardier  Transportation's subsidiaries in Brazil, and certain current and former employees of the Group.

CADE ruled in July 2019 a financial fine of BRL 133 million (approximately €24 million) on Alstom's subsidiary in Brazil as well as a ban to participate in public procurement bids in Brazil conducted by the Federal, State, and Municipal Public  Administration  over  a  period  of  5  years.  In  parallel,  CADE  applied  a  financial  penalty  of  BRL  23  million (approximately €4 million) on Bombardier Transportation's subsidiary in Brazil (there is no ban to participate in public procurement bids in Brazil).

In September and December 2020, both Alstom and Bombardier Transportation's subsidiaries in Brazil filed a civil lawsuit  before  the  Brasilia  civil  court  aiming  at  suspending  and  ultimately  cancelling  the  July  2019  ruling.  Both subsidiaries obtained an injunction to suspend the effects of the administrative ruling until a final judgment is issued on the merits.

The public prosecutor of the State of Sao Paulo launched in May 2014 a civil action against the Group's subsidiaries in Brazil, along with a number of other companies, for a total amount asserted against all companies of BRL 2.5 billion (approximately €453 million) excluding interests and possible damages in connection with a transportation project.

In December 2014, the public prosecutor of the State of Sao Paulo also initiated a lawsuit against Alstom's subsidiaries in Brazil, along with a number of other companies (including now Bombardier Transportation's local subsidiary) related to alleged anti-competitive practices regarding the first phase of a train maintenance project, and in the last quarter of 2016, regarding a second phase of the said maintenance project.

The Group's subsidiaries are actively defending themselves against these two actions.

In case of proven illicit practices, possible sanctions can include the cancellation of the relevant contracts, the payment of  damage  compensation,  the  payment  of  punitive  damages  and/or  the  dissolution  of  the  Brazilian  subsidiaries involved.

## Italy

On 23 June 2020, a series of searches and arrests have been carried out by the Milan police under instructions of the Milan Prosecution Office as part of a preliminary investigation into alleged bribes and bid-rigging in connection with public tenders for Azienda Transporte Milanesi ('ATM'), the municipal public transport company and operator of the Milan  Subway.  The  investigation  concerns  at  least  seven  companies  and  28  individuals,  including  three  current employees and one former employee of Alstom Ferroviaria S.p.A (the 'Alstom Italy employees').

The Prosecution Office alleges that the Alstom Italy employees engaged in bid-rigging under Article 353 of the Italian Criminal Code, including colluding with an employee of ATM, to obtain confidential technical information in order to secure an undue advantage in the tender process for a 2019 contract for the Milan subway. Alstom did not ultimately submit a bid in respect of this contract.

Alstom Ferroviaria S.p.A. is also subject to investigation regarding alleged violation of Legislative Decree No. 231/2001 ('Decree 231/2001') for not having implemented (or not having efficiently applied) a system of control capable to

<!-- image -->

avoid the commission by its employees of corruption. A company may only be held liable under Decree 231 if the criminal misconduct of its employees is established. In such a case, a company may seek to defend itself from corporate liability under Decree 231/2001 by showing that it had adopted and effectively implemented an organizational model (known  as  a  'Modello')  to  prevent  misconduct  and  established  an  independent  supervisory  body  (known  as  an 'organismo di vigilenza') to oversee compliance with the Modello. Alstom Ferroviaria S.p.A. has adopted a Modello and has established an 'organismo di vigilenza'.

Alstom is conducting an internal investigation into the allegations discussed above in coordination with external counsel and has  taken  certain  interim  measures  in  response  to  the  allegations  of  the  Prosecution  Office,  in  particular  by suspending one of its employees of Alstom Ferroviaria S.p.A.

In August 2022, the Prosecution Office determined (i) withdrawal of the bribery charges against Alstom Ferroviaria S.p.A.  and  the  individuals  and  (ii)  is  seeking  for  indictment  of  two  former  and  two  current  employees  of  Alstom Ferroviaria S.p.A for bid rigging. The judge of Preliminary Investigations is now to decide on such determinations.

In November 2022, ATM and the Milan Municipality joined the proceedings as offended parties ('costituzione di parte civile').

## Spain

The Spanish Competition Authority ('CNMC') opened a formal procedure end of August 2018 in connection with alleged irregularities in public tenders with the Spanish Railway Infrastructures Administrator ('ADIF') against eight competing companies active in the Spanish signaling market including Bombardier European Investments, S.L.U (BEI) and its parent company Bombardier Transportation (Global Holding) UK Limited, and Alstom Transporte SA and its parent Alstom SA. The inclusion of the parent company is typical of European competition authorities at the early stage of the proceedings. No Alstom or Bombardier managers were included in the file. In September 2020, the companies obtained access to the Statement of Objections in which the CNMC discloses the evidence gathered against the various participants in the alleged cartel in the Spanish signaling market. Both Alstom and Bombardier have submitted their defense paper rejecting all of CNMC allegations on the basis of absence of evidence. The Sub-directorate of the CNMC submitted a Proposed Resolution end of March 2021 which both Alstom and Bombardier rejected. Both companies submitted their defence to the Council of the CNMC.

The Council of the CNMC ruled in September 2021 a financial fine of €22 million and €3.7 million on Alstom's subsidiary and Bombardier Transportation's subsidiary in Spain respectively. The Council also ruled a ban to participate in public procurement bids in Spain. The scope and duration of the ban to participate in public procurement both for Alstom's and Bombardier Transportation's subsidiaries in Spain remain to be set by the State Public Procurement Advisory Board (Junta Consultiva de Contratación Pública del Estado).

On 29 November and 7 December 2021 Alstom's subsidiary and Bombardier Transportation's subsidiary in Spain respectively lodged an appeal against this ruling of the Council of the CNMC before the National High Court ('Audiencia Nacional'). The Group believes that the grounds of appeal are solid. On 23 September 2022, Alstom's subsidiaries in Spain filed their respective statement of claim under the appeal proceedings.

In parallel to these appeals, Alstom's and Bombardier Transportation's subsidiaries in Spain have respectively requested to the National High Court, as an interim measure, to suspend the implementation of the Council ruling regarding (i) the payment of the financial fine and (ii) the prohibition to tender in public procurement bids in Spain. On the 1 and on the 14 February 2022 respectively,  the  National  High Court accepted both requests for interim  measures and granted such suspension.

## Pending investigations which relate to Bombardier Transportation

The matters described in this section relate to historical conduct involving Bombardier Transportation that occurred prior to Alstom's acquisition.

Bombardier Transportation is the subject of an audit of the World Bank Integrity Vice Presidency and is participating in several investigations relating to allegations of corruption including by the Swedish Prosecution authority, the Special Investigation Unit (SIU) and National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) in South Africa and the DOJ.

With respect to these above-mentioned matters, Alstom and/or Bombardier Inc. are cooperating with the concerned authorities or institutions. These investigations or procedures may result in criminal sanctions, including fines which may be significant, exclusion of Group's subsidiaries from tenders and third-party actions. In this context, Alstom has obtained a number of contractual protections in the acquisition of Bombardier Transportation to mitigate potential risks.

The matter under investigation by the Swedish authorities, the World Bank and the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) (cf. details below) is in relation to a 2013 contract for the supply of equipment and services to Azerbaijan Railways in the amount of approximately $340 million (principally financed by the World Bank) awarded to a bidding consortium composed of Bombardier Transportation's Sweden's subsidiary (BT Sweden), a Russian Bombardier Transportation affiliate  (with  third  party  shareholders)  and  a  third  party  (the  'ADY  Contract').  Ownership  of  the  affiliate  was subsequently transferred to an entity well established in the Russian and CIS market with which BT Sweden had a historical relationship, and an affiliate of which had been added post-bid approval as a project sub-contractor. There remains uncertainty as to the services provided by these entities in return for some of the payments they received.

## Sweden

The Swedish authorities commenced an investigation in relation to the ADY Contract in 2016, and in 2017 filed charges against the former head of Sales, North Region, RCS, BT Sweden (the 'former BTS employee') for aggravated bribery, and  alternatively,  influence  trafficking.  The  authorities  alleged  that  the  former  BTS  employee  had  contacts  and correspondence  with  a  representative  of  the  third-party  member  of  the  consortium  who  was  also  employed  by Azerbaijan railways during the bidding period with a view towards illicitly influencing the outcome of the tender.

After a trial the former BTS employee was acquitted on both counts in 2017. The authorities appealed the decision and as of today only the aggravated bribery charge is pending. Although no charges have been filed against BT Sweden to date, the Swedish authorities are investigating other former BT Sweden employees and made mutual legal assistance treaty requests to authorities in numerous jurisdictions. The Swedish authorities recently concluded investigations on another  former  BT  Sweden  employee  and  filed  charges.  In  December  2021,  the  Swedish  Court  issued  a  decision acquitting the former BTS employee. The authorities appealed such decision, and the matter is pending.

## World Bank

The World Bank audited the ADY Contract and in 2018 the World Bank's Integrity Vice Presidency ('INT') issued a strictly confidential show cause letter which was leaked. The letter outlines INT's position regarding alleged collusion, corruption and fraud in the ADY Contract and obstruction of the INT's investigation. The audit could result in some form of debarment of Bombardier Transportation and BT Sweden from bidding on contracts financed by the World Bank for a number of years.

## U.S. Department of Justice - DOJ

On 10 February, 2020, the DOJ notified Bombardier that it had opened an investigation. The DOJ has made information requests since March 2020 to Bombardier Inc. regarding the ADY Contract and may be doing so in the near term in relation  to  other  projects  in  CIS  countries.  The  DOJ  has  also  made  information  requests  regarding  contracts  with Transnet (cf. below South-Africa and Project related litigation- South-Africa) and a Bombardier Transportation South Africa signaling contract with the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (PRASA).

## South Africa

Bombardier Transportation South Africa's contract to supply locomotives to Transnet Freight Rail is one of the matters among numerous other matters under investigation by the judicial commission of inquiry into allegations of State Capture (the 'Zondo Commission'), by the Special Investigation Unit in South Africa ('SIU'), and by the National Prosecuting Authority ('NPA').

## Project execution related litigation

## CR-1 Marmaray railway infrastructure - Turkey

In March 2007, the Turkish Ministry of Transport (DLH) awarded the contract to upgrade approximately 75 km of railway  infrastructure  in  the  Istanbul  region,  known  as  the  'Marmaray  Commuter  Rail  Project  (CR-1)'  to  the consortium Alstom Dogus Marubeni (AMD), of which Alstom Transport's main French subsidiary is a member. This project, which included works on the transcontinental railway tunnel under the Bosphorus, has undergone significant delays  mainly  due  to  difficulties  for  the  DLH  to  make  the  construction  site  available.  Thus,  the  AMD  consortium terminated the contract in 2010. This termination was challenged by DLH, who thereafter called the bank guarantees issued by the consortium up to an amount of approximately €80 million. Following injunctions, the payment of such bank guarantees was forbidden, and the AMD consortium immediately initiated an arbitration procedure to resolve the substantive issues. The arbitral tribunal has decided in December 2014 that the contract stands as terminated by virtue of Turkish law and has authorized the parties to submit their claims for compensation of the damages arising from such termination.

The set off of the various amounts awarded by the tribunal to both parties after more than ten years of proceedings resulted, in a net amount, after set-off, of €27.4 million payable by the AMD consortium to DLH. AMD partners paid their respective proportionate share to the Ministry (Alstom share being €8.5 million) during the summer of 2021. Bonds  were  released  and  the  case  is  therefore  closed  subject  to  the  process  of  release  of  counter-guarantees respectively issued by AMD's partners which is ongoing.

On  the  other  hand,  through  arbitration  request  notified  on  29  September  2015,  Marubeni  Corporation  launched proceedings against Alstom Transport SA taken as consortium leader in order to be compensated for the consequences of the termination of the contract with AMD. In a similar fashion, through arbitration request issued on 15 March 2016, the other consortium member Dogus launched proceedings against Alstom Transport SA with similar demands and a request to have the disputes between consortium members consolidated in a single case. Alstom Transport SA is rejecting these compensation requests and is defending itself in these proceedings between consortium members which, while having gone through a consolidation in a single case, have however been suspended by the arbitral tribunal pending the outcome of the main arbitral proceedings between AMD and DLH. In October 2018, Dogus applied for interim measures to clarify certain aspects of the consortium agreement and this request was rejected by the arbitral tribunal on account of the suspension. In January 2021, Dogus filed an application to resume arbitration proceedings while Alstom filed a successful application seeking an order of payment according to partners' net proportionate shares (see above). In accordance with the timetable defined by the case management team, Dogus and Marubeni filed their

<!-- image -->

respective statements of claims on 30 September 2021 and Alstom submitted its defense and counterclaims on 14 February 2022. On 28 April 2022, the arbitral tribunal issued an order to close the document production phase of the proceedings. On 9 September 2022 and on 13 February 2023, Dogus and Marubeni filed their respective replies and statements of defense to Alstom's counterclaims and their rejoinder to which Alstom responded on 30 November 2022 and on 20 February 2023 by filing its rejoinder and reply on counterclaims. The arbitral tribunal hearing started on 20 March and ended on 29 March 2023, following which a final decision on the dispute is expected before the end of 2023.

Regional Minuetto trains & high-speed Pendolino trains - Italy

Alstom  Transport's  subsidiary  in  Italy  is  involved  in  two  litigation  proceedings  with  the  Italian  railway  company Trenitalia. One is related to a supply contract of regional Minuetto trains awarded in 2001 (the 'Minuetto case'), and the other to a supply contract of high-speed Pendolino trains awarded in 2004 (the 'Pendolino case'). Each of these contracts  has  undergone  technical  issues  and  delays  leading  the  Trenitalia  company  to  apply  delay  and  technical penalties and, consequently, to withhold payments. Since the parties dispute certain technical matters as well as the causes and responsibilities of the delays, the matter was brought before Italian courts in 2010 and 2011 respectively. In the Minuetto case on 26 June 2019, the Court of Cuneo issued its decision, which Alstom after careful and detailed analysis considered to be wrong for various legal reasons. On 24 January 2020 Alstom appealed, and on 12 May 2020 Trenitalia  counter  appealed,  the  decision  before  the  Court  of  Appeal  of  Turin.  Proceedings  took  place  and  on  24 December 2021 ALSTOM received the Court of Appeal's decision. The Court of Appeal notably (i) rejected Alstom's request to order supplementary technical expertise and (ii) did not recognize Alstom's economic dependence vis-à-vis Trenitalia, which led consequently to the rejection of Alstom's request to have the penalties clause declared null, as opposed to the first-degree decision. However, the Court of Appeal confirmed the first-degree decision regarding (i) the amount of the penalties due to Trenitalia and (ii) the fact that Trenitalia could not obtain the corresponding payment based on procedural grounds. On 21 June 2022, Alstom appealed the decision by filling a recourse to the Supreme Court to which Trenitalia responded by filing its defense and a counter recourse on 1 August 2022. The preliminary decision of the Filter Section ('Sezione Filtro') of the Supreme Court, that shall be limited to the admissibility of the recourse, is not expected before end of 2023.

In  the  Pendolino  case,  the  technical  expertise  report  was  released,  and  Alstom  has  obtained  certain  corrections following its challenge on some of the conclusions of the report. After the closing of the expertise phase the proceedings continued their path on the legal aspects of the dispute. The tribunal rendered in March 2019 a decision acknowledging that a significant part of the delays was not attributable to Alstom and therefore reduced a large portion of the delay damages claimed by Trenitalia. The tribunal also rejected the reliability penalties claimed by Trenitalia while accepting certain of its residual damage compensation requests. Finally, the tribunal accepted Alstom's claims linked to contract price adjustment formula while rejecting some of its other cost compensation claims. Alstom appealed the decision on 7 October 2019. On 15 January 2020 Trenitalia filed its defense and counter-appeal. After postponement of the initial date the Court of Appeal of Rome fixed the first hearing to 30 September 2022 during which the parties to the dispute summarized their respective positions. The Court of Appeal of Rome ordered Alstom and Trenitalia to file (i) their final briefs on 29 November 2022 and (ii) their respective reply to the other party's final briefs on 19 December 2022. On 10 January 2023 the Court of Appeal of Rome issued its decision that was notified to Alstom on 22 February 2023. The Court of Appeal confirmed the ruling of the first-degree judgment in favour of Alstom in its entirety except for the recognition of the economic dependence of Alstom vis-à-vis Trenitalia. Alstom filed a recourse before the Supreme Court against this decision.

## Saturno - Italy

Following a dispute within a consortium involving Alstom's subsidiary in Italy and three other Italian companies, the arbitral tribunal constituted to resolve the matter has rendered in August 2016 a decision against Alstom by awarding €22 million of damage compensation to the other consortium members. Alstom's subsidiary strongly contests this decision and considers that it should be able to avoid its enforcement and thus prevent any damage compensation payment. On 30 November 2016, Alstom's subsidiary filed a motion in the Court of Appeals of Milan to obtain the cancellation of the arbitral award. On 1 December 2016, Alstom's subsidiary filed an ex parte motion for injunctive relief  to  obtain  the  suspension  of  the  arbitral  award  pending  the  outcome  of  the  appeal  proceedings,  which  was temporarily accepted by the Court. After a phase of hearings in contradictory proceedings on the request for suspension of  the  arbitral  award,  the  Court  of  Appeal  of  Milan  decided  on  3  March  2017  in  favor  of  Alstom's  subsidiary  by confirming definitively the suspension of this arbitration decision pending the outcome of the proceedings relating to the cancellation of such decision. The Court of Appeal of Milan ruled on the merits in March 2019 in favour of the Alstom's  subsidiary  and  cancelled  the  arbitration  award  of  August  2016  including  the  €22  million  of  damage compensation. The members of the consortium (excluding Alstom) appealed the decision of the Court of Appeal of Milan on 19 October 2019. On 27 November 2019 Alstom filed its defense and counter-appeal. The parties are still waiting for a decision on the admissibility of the recourse, to be given by the so-called 'Filter Section' of the Supreme Court.

## South-Africa

On 17 March 2014, Bombardier Transportation South Africa (BTSA) entered into a locomotive supply agreement with Transnet  for  the  supply  of  240  electric  locomotives  (LSA).  The  LSA  is  part  of  Transnet's  1064  locomotive  project concluded between Transnet and four Original Equipment Manufacturers including BTSA.

On 9 March 2021, Transnet and the Special Investigating Unit (SIU), alleging unlawfulness and irregularities in the procurement process and subsequent award of the 1064 locomotive project, launched review application proceedings in the High Court of South Africa (High Court) for, amongst other things, the review and setting aside of the respective LSA's concluded with the four Original Equipment Manufacturers including BTSA. The relief sought by Transnet as it relates to BTSA includes: (i) the review and setting aside of the LSA concluded between BTSA and Transnet on 17 March 2014; (ii) that Transnet be entitled to retain the locomotives delivered by BTSA; and (iii) that BTSA be ordered to make restitution to Transnet of the advance payments and profit and/or excess profit earned in the supply of the locomotives.

On 13 April 2021, the court case team ordered Transnet to provide a properly constituted record of decision (ROD), the ROD being a critical element of Transnet's review application, following the four Original Equipment Manufacturers respective  complaints  addressing  the  incompleteness  of  such  ROD  filed  by  Transnet.  On  17  July  2021  Transnet submitted a revised ROD to the High Court the completeness of which was again challenged by Alstom (BTSA) end of August 2021.

In parallel, on 2 September 2021 two of the Original Equipment Manufacturers filed an interlocutory motion to dismiss in its entirety the review application, such motion being based on Transnet's and SIU's respective failure to bring such review application in due course. This interlocutory motion has been challenged by Transnet requesting the High Court, via an interlocutory application filed on 15 December 2021, to set it aside. The High Court dismissed the two Original Equipment Manufacturers' interlocutory motion on 12 April 2022. The two Original Equipment Manufacturers brought further procedural applications that remain to be ruled upon by the High Court prior to the setting of the date for the submission of the responding affidavits by the four Original Equipment Manufacturers.

These proceedings are at an early stage and the Group is unable, at this stage, to predict their consequences. These matters are also a subject of the investigation by the DOJ, Zondo Commission and the NPA as referenced above.

## Acquisition of Bombardier Transportation - Arbitration Proceedings

With respect to the acquisition of Bombardier Transportation, completed on 29 January 2021, Alstom identified various breaches by Bombardier Inc. ('BI') of its obligations as Seller under the Memorandum of Understanding dated 17 February 2020 (amended and restated on 30 March 2020) and the Sale and Purchase Agreement dated 26 September 2020 (amended on 28 January 2021).

On 15 April 2022, Alstom filed a request for arbitration against BI with the International Chamber of Commerce (in accordance with the Parties' agreements). Alstom's claims against BI concern breaches of the interim covenants in force  prior  to  completion,  breaches  of  warranty,  and  claims  related  to  the  calculation  of  the  final  purchase price.  Notably, Alstom contends that BI's actions prior to completion wrongfully increased the purchase price paid by Alstom.  On 24 June 2022, BI filed its answer to the request for arbitration, denying Alstom's claims and advancing counterclaims.  As  yet,  BI  has  provided  limited  information  on  the  underlying  facts,  and  legal  bases,  for  its counterclaims.

The arbitral tribunal was constituted by the International Chamber of Commerce on 26 August 2022.  In October 2022, the tribunal established a procedural timetable leading to an evidentiary hearing in late 2025. On 3 March 2023, Alstom filed its full Statement of Claim to which BI is expected to respond in Q2 of the 2023/24 fiscal year.

## Sale of Alstom's Energy Businesses in November 2015

Finally, it shall be noted that, by taking over Alstom's Energy Businesses in November 2015, General Electric undertook to assume all risks and liabilities exclusively or predominantly associated with said businesses and in a symmetrical way,  Alstom  undertook  to  keep  all  risks  and  liabilities  associated  with  the  non-transferred  business.  Crossindemnification for a duration of 30 years and asset reallocation ('wrong pocket') mechanisms have been established to ensure that, on the one hand, assets and liabilities associated with the Energy businesses being sold are indeed transferred to General Electric and on the other hand, assets and liabilities not associated with such businesses are borne by Alstom. As a result, the consequences of litigation matters that were on-going at the time of the sale and associated with these transferred activities are taken over by General Electric. Indemnity provisions protect Alstom in case of third-party claims directed at Alstom and relating to the transferred activities. For this reason and since Alstom no longer manages these litigation matters, Alstom is ceasing to include them in this section.

There are no other governmental, legal or arbitration procedures, including proceedings of which the Group is aware, and which are pending or threatening, which might have, or have had during the last twelve months, a significant impact on the financial situation or profitability of the Group.
