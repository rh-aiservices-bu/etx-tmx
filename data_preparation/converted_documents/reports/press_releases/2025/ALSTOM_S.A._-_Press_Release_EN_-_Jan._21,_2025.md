## Detailed review

During  the  third  quarter  of  2024/25  (from  1  October  to  31  December  2024),  Alstom  recorded € 4,260 million in orders, compared to €5, 452 million over the same period last fiscal year.

Orders for Services and Signalling reached 65% of the third quarter order intake, and 58% over 9 months.

On a regional level, Europe accounts for 64% of the Group 's  third  qu arter order intake. Alstom has received new orders from two undisclosed European customers for a total amount of €760 million . The first order worth approximately €500 million concerns supply of materials and components on Alstom fleets for  the  next  23  years.  The  second  order  worth  approximately  €260  million concerns  a  full maintenance services agreement for 9 years on a regional trains fleet, including first level maintenance and mid-life overhaul.

In France, Alstom will supply SNCF Voyageurs with 35 additional RER NG trains for the RER E line on the Île-de-France Mobilités network. Worth € 520 million euros, this new order is a call-off on the frame agreement signed in 2017 and brings to 166 the total number of trains ordered for the RER D and RER E lines, out of an estimated overall need of 255 trains.

In Lille, Alstom will supply the Métropole Européenne de Lille (MEL) with 15 additional 52-metre long new-generation automated metro trainsets, at a price of around € 210 million euro. These new trains will complete the first batch of 27 trains already ordered by the MEL and equipped with the new Urbalis Fluence signalling and automatic control system.

In the Americas, Alstom was awarded a contract by the Southern California Regional Rail Authority (Metrolink) to operate, service, and maintain their regional passenger rail system. The contract is valued at approximately $515 million (€490 million) and will run from January 1, 2025, to June 30, 2030, employing more than 400 Alstom team members in Southern California. The contract allows for a potential three-year extension.

Alstom also renewed a contract with Denver International Airport to operate and maintain their Innovia Automated People Mover (APM) system over the course of seven years. The new contract is valued at €218 million .

The level of base orders (less than € 200 million of contract value) exceeded € 2 billion this quarter.

## Sales were € 4,672 million in Q3 2024/25 compared to € 4,332 million in Q3 2023/24.

Over 9 months, sales amounted to €1 3,448 million, representing a growth of 5.3% on a reported basis and a sound 6.9% on an organic basis compared with Alstom sales in the same period last fiscal year.

For the same period, Rolling Stock sales reached € 6,969 million, representing an increase of 3% on a reported basis and 3% on an organic basis, driven by a ramp-up of projects in Australia as well as a consistent execution in France and Italy.

Signalling sales stood at € 1,880 million for the 9 months, down (2)% on a reported basis and up 4% on an organic basis, led by a consistent execution in Italy, Germany and France but impacted by the sale of US conventional signalling activities to Knorr-Bremse.

In Systems, Alstom reported € 1,342 million sales for the 9 months, up 20% on a reported basis and 26% on an organic basis, on the back of a good performance of Turnkey Systems projects in France, Ivory Coast and Saudi Arabia and strong deliveries in Mexico.

Services  continues  to deliver  a  sustained  performance  and  reported  € 3,257  million  of  sales  over  9 months, up 9% on a reported basis and 11% on an organic basis, benefiting from a solid execution in Germany and a ramp-up of projects in UK and the US.

The book-to-bill ratio is 0.9 over the quarter and 1.1 over 9 months.

## Key project deliveries

In  October  2024,  Mumbai  Metro's  Aqua  Line  was  inaugurated  for  commercial  operation  with Metropolis trains and signalling solutions supplied by Alstom. The contract includes the manufacturing of 31 metro trains of 8 cars each. Alstom also delivered the first driverless trainset for Chennai Metro Phase II: 36 trains equipped with Automatic Train Operation (ATO) and Automatic Train Protection (ATP).

In November, Alstom introduced for the first time in Spain, its APS catenary-free technology, a dynamic groundbased feeding system, on the new extension of Barcelona's tramway.

Alstom also celebrated the launch of the Riyadh Metro network, a key milestone of the ambitious plans outlined by the Royal Commission for Riyadh City, 176km network, encompassing six lines, 85 stations, seven  depots.  Alstom's  contribution  includes  47  Innovia  metro  trains  for the  Orange  line  and  69 Metropolis metro trains for the Yellow, Green, and Purple lines custom-designed for Riyadh's specific needs.

In Taiwan, Alstom delivered the first fully automated Metropolis trainset for Taipei's Wanda -ZhongheShulin  Line  (35  Metropolis  metro  trains  equipped  with  the  Urbalis  CBTC  driverless  signalling system). The  22.8-kilometre  metro  line  will  enable  seamless  connections  between  Taipei  and  New Taipei City, reducing travel time by 30 minutes. In the Philippines, Alstom's first integrated system entered service with the first phase of the Manila LRT-1 Cavite extension.

In December, in France, Ile-de-France Mobilités, SNCF Voyageurs and Alstom together celebrated the commissioning of the 'New Generation RER', on RER D Line (600,000 passengers every day).

In Brazil, the 36 th and last train for Lines 8 and 9 (more than one million passengers a day) of the São Paulo Metropolitan Train Network was delivered to ViaMobilidade.

## APPENDIX 2 - NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INDICATORS DEFINITIONS

This section presents financial indicators used by the Group that are not defined by accounting standard setters.

## Orders received

A new order is recognised as an order received only when the contract creates enforceable obligations between the Group and its customer. When this condition is met, the order is recognised at the contract value.  If the contract is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the reporting unit, the Group requires the immediate elimination of currency exposure using forward currency sales. Orders are then measured using the spot rate at inception of hedging instruments.

## Book-to-Bill

The book-to-bill ratio is the ratio of orders received to the amount of sales traded for a specific period.

## Gross margin % on backlog

Gross Margin % on backlog is a KPI that presents the expected performance level of firm contracts in backlog. It represents the difference between the sales not yet recognized and the cost of sales not yet incurred from the contracts in backlog. This % is an average of the portfolio of contracts in backlog and is meaningful to project midand long-term profitability.

## Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA

Adjusted  Gross  Margin  before  PPA  is  a  KPI  that  presents  the  level  of  recurring  operational  performance.  It represents the sales minus the cost of sales, adjusted to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination as well as significant, non-recurring 'one off' items that are not expected to occur again in subsequent years.

## EBIT before PPA

Following the Bombardier Transportation acquisition and with effect from the fiscal year 2021/22 condensed consolidated financial statements, Alstom decided to introduce the 'EBIT before PPA' KPI aimed at restating its Earnings Before Interest and Taxes ('EBIT') to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination. This KPI is also aligned with market practice.

## Adjusted EBIT

Adjusted  EBIT  ('aEBIT')  is  the  Key  Performance  Indicator  to  present  the  level  of  recurring  operational

performance. This indicator is also aligned with market practice and comparable to direct competitors. Starting September 2019, Alstom has opted for the inclusion of the share in net income of the equity-accounted investments into the aEBIT when these are considered to be part of the operating activities of the Group (because there are significant operational flows and/or common project execution with these entities). This mainly includes Chinese joint ventures, namely CASCO joint venture for Alstom as well as, following the integration of Bombardier Transportation, Alstom Sifang (Qingdao) Transportation Ltd., Jiangsu Alstom NUG Propulsion System Co. Ltd aEBIT corresponds to Earning Before Interests and Tax adjusted for the following elements:

<!-- image -->

- · net restructuring expenses (including rationalization costs)
- · tangibles and intangibles impairment
- · capital gains or loss/revaluation on investments disposals or controls changes of an entity.
- · any  other  non-recurring  items,  such  as  some  costs  incurred  to  realize  business  combinations  and amortisation of an asset exclusively valued in the context of business combination, as well as litigation costs that have arisen outside the ordinary course of business.
- · and including the share in net income of the operational equity-accounted investments

A nonrecurring item is a 'one -off' exceptional item that is not supposed to occur again in following years and that is significant.

Adjusted EBIT margin corresponds to Adjusted EBIT expressed as a percentage of sales.

## EBITDA + JV dividends

EBITDA  before  PPA  plus  dividends  from  joint  ventures  is  the  EBIT  before  PPA,  before  depreciation  and amortisation, with the addition of the dividends received from joint ventures.

## Adjusted net profit

The 'Adjusted Net Profit' KPI restates Alstom's net profit from continued operations (Group share) to exclude the impact  of  amortisation  of  assets  exclusively  valued  when  determining  the  PPA  in  the  context  of  business combination, net of the corresponding tax effect. This indicator is also aligned with market practice.

## Free cash flow

Free  Cash  Flow  is  defined  as  net  cash  provided  by  operating  activities  less  capital  expenditures  including capitalised development costs, net of proceeds from disposals of tangible and intangible assets. Free Cash Flow does not include any proceeds from disposals of activity.

The most directly comparable financial measure to Free Cash Flow calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS is net cash provided by operating activities.

## Funds from Operations

Funds from Operations 'FFO' in the EBIT to FCF statement refers to the Free Cash Flow generated by Operations, before Working Capital variations.

## Contract and Trade Working Capital

Contract Working Capital is the sum of:

- · Contract Assets & Liabilities, which includes the Customer Down-Payments
- · Current provisions, which includes Risks on contracts and Warranties

Trade Working Capital is the Working Capital that is not strictly contractual, hence not included in Project Working Capital. It includes:

<!-- image -->

- · Inventories
- · Trade Receivables
- · Trade Payables
- · Other elements of Working Capital defined as the sum of Other Current Assets/Liabilities and NonCurrent provisions

## Net cash/(debt)

The net cash/(debt) is defined as cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and other current financial asset, less borrowings.

## Pay-out ratio

The payout ratio is calculated by dividing the amount of the overall dividend with the 'Adjusted Net profit from continuing operations attributable to equity holders of the parent, Group share' as presented in the management report in the consolidated financial statements.

## Organic basis

This press release includes performance indicators presented on a reported basis and on an organic basis. Figures given on an organic basis eliminate the impact of changes in scope of consolidation and changes resulting from the translation of the accounts into Euro following the variation of foreign currencies against the Euro.

The Group uses figures prepared on an organic basis both for internal analysis and for external communication, as it believes they provide means to analyse and explain variations from one period to another. However, these figures are not measurements of performance under IFRS.
