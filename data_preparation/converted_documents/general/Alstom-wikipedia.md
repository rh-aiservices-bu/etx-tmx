## Alstom

Alstom  SA is a French  multinational  rolling  stock manufacturer  which  operates  worldwide  in  rail  transport markets. It is active in the fi elds of passenger transportation, signaling, and locomotives, producing high-speed, suburban, regional and urban trains along with trams.

 e company and its name (originally spelled Alsthom) was formed  by  a  merger  between  the  electric  engineering division of Société Alsacienne de Constructions Mécaniques (Als) and Compagnie Française  omson-Houston (thom) in 1928. Signi fi cant acquisitions later included the Constructions  Électriques  de  France  (1932),  shipbuilder Chantiers  de  l'Atlantique  (1976),  and  parts  of  ACEC  (late1980s).

A  merger  with  parts  of  the  British  General  Electric Company  formed  GEC  Alsthom  in  1989.  roughout  the 1990s, the company expanded its holdings in the rail sector, acquiring German  rolling  stock manufacturer LinkeHofmann-Busch  and  Italian  rail  signaling  specialist  Sasib Railways.  In  1998,  GEC  Alsthom  was  listed  on  the  Paris Stock  Exchange  and,  later  that  year,  it  was  rebranded Alstom.  At  the  time,  the  company  was  manufacturing railway  rolling  stock,  power  generation  equipment  and ships.

In 2003, the company required a € 3.2 billion bailout from the French  government.  As  a  result,  Alstom  was  compelled  to dispose of several of its divisions, including shipbuilding and electrical transmission to Areva, [4] in order to comply with European  Union  rules  on  state  aid.  In  2004,  Alstom remained  in fi nancial  di ffi culties,  having  incurred  massive unexpected  costs  ( € 4  billion)  arising  from  a  design fl aw inherited from the acquisition of ABB's turbine business, in addition to losses in other business sectors.

In  2014,  General  Electric  (GE)  announced  that  it  reached  a deal  to  purchase  Alstom's  power  and  grid  divisions  for US$17  billion  ( € 12.4  billion).  e  deal  came  under  heavy

In an a  empt to grow its rail business, in late-2017, Alstom announced a proposed merger with Siemens Mobility. However, in February 2019, the European Commission prohibited the merger. Subsequently, in February 2020, the company signed a le  er of agreement to purchase the  transportation  division  of  the fi nancially  struggling  Bombardier  Inc.  e  purchase  was fi nalized  in January 2021.

## History

## Alsthom (1928-1989)

Alsthom  was  founded  in  1928  from  the  merger  of  French  heavy  engineering  subsidiary  of  the  omsonHouston  Electric  Company -the  Compagnie  Française  omson  Houston,  CFTH -and  the  Société Alsacienne  de  Constructions  Mécaniques.  In  1932,  Alsthom  expanded  into  transportation  by  acquiring  the French: Constructions Électriques de France , Tarbes; a manufacturer of electric locomotives as well as electrical and hydraulic equipment.

In  1969,  Compagnie  Générale  d'Électricité  (CGE)  became  the  majority  shareholder  of  Alsthom.  In  1976, Alsthom merged with Chantiers de l'Atlantique, becoming Alsthom Atlantique.  us, the business expanded into marine.  e next year, it constructed the fi rst 1300 MW generator set for the Paluel Nuclear Power Plant, se  ing a world record with an output of 1500 MW.

In 1978, Alsthom delivered its fi rst TGV to SNCF.  e TGV went on to break world rail speed records in 1981 (at 380 kilometres per hour (240 mph)) and in 1990 (at 515.3 kilometres per hour (320.2 mph)). It also set the world endurance record for high-speed train lines in 2001, travelling the 1,067.2 kilometres (663.1 mi) from Calais to Marseille in 3 hours and 29 minutes. In 1986, Alsthom Belfort received an order from EDF for the largest gas turbine in the world (212 MW).

In 1988 -89, holding company CGEE Alsthom acquired ACEC Énergie (hydroturbines and electrical equipment for  the  nuclear  industry)  and  ACEC  Automatisme  (automation)  from  the  dissolution  of  Belgian  electrical engineering  company  ACEC.  Alsthom  acquired  100%  of  ACEC's  transport  division,  renaming  it ACEC Transport . [5]

## GEC Alsthom (1989-1998)

In early 1989, GEC Alsthom was formed from a 50 -50 merger of Alsthom and the Power Systems Division of the  British  General  Electric  Company;  for  Alsthom  this  move  was  intended  to  aid  Alsthom  in  selling  its products  outside  the  French  market. [6] In  May  of  that  year  GEC  Alsthom  bought  British  rail  vehicle manufacturer Metro-Cammell. [7]

During the early-1990s, GEC Alsthom was the principal manufacturer of  the  British  Rail  Class  373,  a  variant  of  their  TGV  family  specially designed  for  traversing  the  Channel  Tunnel  between  the  UK  and France.  Although  collectively  operated  by  Eurostar,  the  type  was ordered  by  three  di ff erent  railway  companies:  16  by  SNCF,  four  by NMBS/SNCB, and 18 by British  Rail,  of  which  seven  were  shortened North of London sets. [8]  e fi rst  Class  373  set  was  completed at GEC Alstom's Belfort facility during 1992. [9]

In 1994, GEC Alsthom acquired a 51% shareholding in Linke-HofmannBusch  from  Salzgi  er  AG. [10] In  1995,  the  company  acquired  the remaining shares in the steam turbine manufacturer MAN Energie. [11] In early 1998, GEC Alsthom acquired the electrical contractor Cegelec, renaming it Alstom Power Conversion . [12]

In  1998,  GEC  Alsthom  bought  Italian fi rm  SASIB's  rail  signalling subsidiary Sasib Railways , [13][14] which included the former General Railway Signal (USA). [15][16]

In June 1998, GEC Alsthom was listed on the Paris Stock Exchange; both GEC and Alcatel elected to sell o ff part of their stakes (23.6% each). Around this time, the company was o ffi cially renamed Alstom . [17][18]

## Alstom (1999-2014)

In 1999, Alstom bought half of ABB's power systems division, forming a 50-50 joint company known as ABB Alstom Power. Alstom also bought Canada's  Télécité,  a  passenger  information  and  security  solutions company,  and  sold  its  heavy-duty  gas  turbine  business  to  General Electric. [19][20]  e next year, the company bought out ABB's share in the former joint venture ABB Alstom Power. [21]

In 2000, Alstom sold its diesel engine businesses (Ruston, Paxman, and Mirrlees Blackstone) to MAN Group. [22] It also acquired a 51% stake in

Italian  rail  manufacturer  Fiat  Ferroviaria,  a  world  leader  in  tilting

technology. [23] In April 2003, Alstom sold its industrial turbine business to Siemens for € 1.1 billion. [24]

By  2003,  Alstom  was  facing  a fi nancial  crisis  caused  by  a  mix  of  poor  sales  and  over  $5  billion  of  debt liabilities. It reportedly had the potential to force the company's liquidation.  ese heavy debts were largely due to a $4 billion charge over a design fl aw in a turbine developed by ABB, acquired by Alstom in 2000, as well as the collapse of customer Renaissance Cruises amid a general downturn in the marine market. Alstom's

share  price  had  dropped  by  90%  over  two  years. [25][26] European  competition  commission  law  required Alstom to sell several of its subsidiaries, including its shipbuilding and electrical transmission assets, when it accepted a € 3.2 billion rescue plan involving the French state. [27]

In 2004, the French state took a 21% stake in Alstom for € 772 million and Alstom received an EU-approved bailout  worth in total € 2.5  billion. [28]  e  company sold its electrical transmission and distribution ("grid") activities  to  Areva,  the  diesel  locomotive  manufacturer  Meinfesa  to  Vossloh,  and  Alstom  Power  Rentals  to APR LLC. Six years later, Alstom re-acquired the electric power transmission division of Areva. [29][30]

In  2005,  the  former  Metro-Cammell  rail  vehicle  works  in  Washwood  Heath  closed. [31] In  the  same  year, Alstom sold its Australian subsidiary, Alstom Transport Australia and New Zealand, to United Group, which became part  of  the  la  er's  UGL  Rail  division. [32][33] Alstom  would  restart  its  manufacturing  operations  in Australia by the early 2010s. [34]

In 2006, Alstom sold its Marine Division to the Norwegian group Aker Yards, with a commitment to retain 25% of the shares until 2010; it also sold Alstom Power Conversion, which became Converteam, in a leveraged buy-out deal funded by Barclays Private Equity France SAS. [35]

In June 2006, Bouygues acquired the French government's 21% holding in Alstom for € 2 billion. [36] Later that year, Bouygues elected to increase its shareholding in the fi rm to 24%.

In  2007,  the  TGV  POS  set  the  world  speed  record  for  rail  vehicles  of 574.8  kilometres  per  hour  (357.2  mph).  In  March,  Alstom  acquired Power Systems Manufacturing LLC (Florida, USA) a manufacturer of gas turbine components from Calpine Corporation for $242 million. [37] In June, Alstom  acquired  the  Spanish  wind  turbine  manufacturer Ecotècnia, renamed as Alstom Ecotècnia (since 2010 Alstom Wind).  e company also  adopted  a  new  graphic  chart  (logo,  corporate  identity) using  "alstom"  as  its  trading  name,  reserving  "Alstom  SA"  for  legal documents.

In  2009,  Alstom  acquired  a  25%  stake  in  the  Russian  locomotive manufacturer Transmashholding. [38][39] Six years later, Alstom decided

to  increase  its  shareholding  in  Transmashholding  to  33%  at  a  reported  cost  of € 54  million. [40] As  a consequence of an alignment agreement between Transmashholding and another entity, LocoTech-Service, Alstom's stake in the former decreased to 20% in August 2018. [41]

In 2011, Alstom and the Iraqi government signed a memorandum of understanding regarding the construction of a new high-speed rail line between Baghdad and Basra. [42]

In 2012, Alstom opened construction of factories at Sorel-Tracy,  ebec, Canada (passenger rail vehicles). [43] A  er  a  consortium  of  Alstom  (Alstom  Wind),  EDF,  and  DONG  Energy  was  awarded  three  major  French o ff shore  wind  farm  contracts,  the  company  initiated  construction  of  factories  at  Cherbourg-en-Cotentin (turbine  blades  in  association  with  LM  Power,  also  wind  turbine  towers)  and  Saint-Nazaire  (Nacelles  and generators). [44]

Also in 2012, the company formed a joint venture with RusHydro to manufacture hydropower equipment for small and medium power hydropower plants. (up to about 100MW.) [45]

Late in 2012, to further the development of its tidal energy business, Alstom acquired Tidal Generation Ltd from  Rolls-Royce,  however  this  was  later  sold  to  GE  in  2015  as  part  of  the  sale  of  Alstom's  energy business. [46][47]

In  November  2013,  Alstom  announced  it  planned  to  raise € 1  to € 2  billion  through  sale  of  some  non-core assets, plus the possible sale of a stake in Alstom Transport, and cut 1,300 jobs. [48][49] In 2014, Alstom sold its steam auxiliary components activities (air preheaters and gas-gas heaters for thermal power, other industrial heat transfer equipment, and grinding mills) to Triton Partners for € 730 million. [50]

In November 2014 Alstom was awarded a $429.4 million contract to modernise 85 trains for the Mexico City Metro system. [51]

## Judicial investigations

Starting in 2009, Alstom's practices were questioned by the United States Department of Justice (DOJ), which violated the 1977 Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.  is  American law has extraterritorial scope. At the time, Alstom seemed to cooperate with the proceedings. [52] In 2010, the DOJ opened an investigation into Alstom's commercial practices, focusing on a 2003 deal in Indonesia valued at $118 million in particular. [53]

On  April  13,  2013,  Alstom  senior  executive  Frédéric  Pierucci  was  arrested  at  the  John  F.  Kennedy International Airport in New York. He was accused of willful blindness of his company's suspected corruption and was imprisoned in a high security facility for 14 months and denied release on bail until the week of Alstom's  acquisition  by  the  US  conglomerate  General  Electric. [54][55] In  late  2014,  Alstom  was fi ned $772 million by the DOJ, and admi  ed guilt under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in relation to bribes paid to obtain contracts in various countries. [56][57]

In mid-2014, Alstom Network UK was charged by the UK Serious Fraud O ffi ce (SFO) in relation to corruption o ff ences  alleged  to  have  been  commi  ed  when  obtaining  transportation  contracts  in  India,  Poland  and Tunisia, covered under sections 1 of the Prevention of Corruption Act 1906 and Criminal Law Act 1977. [58] Further charges were brought in late 2014 by the SFO in relation to corrupt practices used to obtain energy contracts in Lithuania. [59] Additional charges relating to contracts for the Budapest Metro in Hungary were added in April 2015. [60] In  December  2018,  three  executives  of  Alstom  were  found  guilty  of  conspiracy  to corrupt following an investigation by the SFO into allegations of several Lithuanian politicians and o ffi cials being o ff ered bribes in return for securing contracts. [61]

In  February  2020,  the  United  Nations  published  a  database  of  all  business  enterprises  involved  in  certain speci fi ed activities related to the Israeli selements. [62][63] Alstom has been listed on the database in light of its involvement in activities related to "the provision of services and utilities supporting the maintenance and existence  of  se  lements"  and  "the  use  of  natural  resources,  in  particular  water  and  land,  for  business

purposes". [62][63] On  5  July  2021,  Norway's  largest  pension  fund  KLP  said  it  would  divest  from  Alstom together with 15 other business entities implicated in the UN report for their links to Israeli se  lements in the occupied West Bank. [64]

## Sale of energy businesses to General Electric

On 24 April 2014, uncon fi rmed reports claimed that US conglomerate General Electric (GE) was in acquisition talks with Alstom for $13 billion with the support of 29%-shareholder Bouygues, causing Alstom's share price to rise 18% in one day. [65] On 27 April, Le Figaro reported that a rival 'cash plus asset swap' o ff er was issued by Siemens, trading Alstom's power business for part of its rail arm, plus a cash o ff er as good as GE's and job guarantees. [66][67] Siemens' bid was reportedly promoted by French economic minister Arnaud Montebourg. Siemens and Alstom had a greater product overlap and thus a greater risk to jobs, along with potential issues with  EU  competition  regulators. [67][68] Siemens'  o ff er  was  characterised  as  "defensive",  being  skeptically received by investors and analysts. [69][70]

On  29  April,  Reuters  reported  that  Alstom's  board  had  accepted  a € 10  billion  bid  by  GE  for  its  energy division; [69] In a le  er from GE executive Je ff rey R. Immelt to President François Hollande published in Les Echos ,  Immelt gave assurances about continued investment in Alstom's French activities, the security of the civil  nuclear  sector,  and  on  job  commitments  made  by  Alstom  Wind,  whilst  making  its  wind  activities available  to  investors. [71] On  30  April,  Alstom  con fi rmed  that  an  o ff er  for  its  power  and  grid  divisions (representing  an  equity  value  of € 12.35  billion, € 11.4  billion  enterprise  value)  was  under  review  with  key interests  including  the  French  state. [72] On  30  April,  GE  con fi rmed  it  had  made  a  $16.9  billion  o ff er, comprising  a  $13.5  billion  value  plus  $3.4  billion  cash. [73] On  5  May,  GE  o ff ered  to  buy  one-fourth  of  the shares in Alstom's Indian power and distribution companies -Alstom T&D India and Alstom India -at 261.25 and 382.20 rupees a share (value US$278 million and $111 million respectively) subject to its bid for Alstom SA being successful. [74]

On  5  May  2014,  the  French  government  stated  it  did  not  back  GE's  bid,  citing  concerns  on  the  future  of Alstom's rail division as a smaller separate entity, suggesting that GE transfer its own rail division to Alstom; other  concerns  were  over  the  civil  nuclear fi eld's  national  independence,  and  French  jobs. [75] On  14  May, France issued a decree ( Décret n° 2014-479 du 14 mai 2014 . [note  1] ),  nicknamed " décret Alstom ",  extending to power of the state to veto the takeover of "strategic interests" into areas of energy supply, water, transport, telecoms  and  public  health. [80][81] Both  the  French  employer  organisation  MEDEF  and  the  European Commissioner for Internal Market and Services (Michel Barnier) responded negatively to the decree. [80][81]

On  16  June,  Siemens  and  Mitsubishi  Heavy  Industries  (MHI)  submi  ed  a  competing  o ff er  for  Siemens  to acquire  Alstom's  gas  turbine  activities  for € 3.9  billion  while  MHI  would  form  joint  ventures  with  Alstom, acquiring 40%, 20% and 20% stakes in Alstom's steam and nuclear, electrical grid, and hydroelectric businesses respectively,  for € 3.1  billion.  e  proposal  included  an  o ff er  to  buy  a  further  10%  stake  from  shareholder Bouygues and an option to form a rail transport joint venture. [82] On 19 June, GE revised its bid, matching the same price with a lower cash transaction value; it also proposed forming a joint venture of their renewable, electric grid, steam turbine and nuclear power businesses. GE announced a memorandum of understanding between the two fi rms in the rail sector and the sale of GE's rail signalling unit to Alstom. [83] On 20 June, Siemens  and  MHI  modi fi ed  their  bid,  with  MHI  increasing  its  stake  in  Alstom's  steam,  hydro,  and  grid businesses  to  40%  in  all  three  (total € 3.9  billion)  while  Siemens  increased  its  o ff er  by € 400  million  to

€ 4.3 billion. [84] Subsequently, Economy minister Arnaud Montebourg stated he would block both bids, but the French government backed GE's o ff er and had given GE more speci fi cations on commitments and guarantees; it also intended to buy two-thirds of Bouygues' shareholding (20%). [85]  e next day, Alstom's board backed GE's  revised  bid. [86][87] On  22  June,  the  French  state  agreed  terms  with  Bouygues,  buying  a  20%  stake  in Alstom from Bouygues at a 2 -5% discount on a minimum value of ≈€ 35 per share. [note 2][88][89][90]

Initially,  the  acquisition  was  expected  to  be fi nalised  by  early  2015. [88] In  early  2015,  the  EU  Competition Commission  began  examining  the  deal. [91] Both  EU  and  US  competition  regulators  approved  the  deal  by September  2015,  subject  to  the  divestiture  of  Alstom's  large  and  very  large  gas  turbine  (GT26  and  GT36 models) manufacturing and service business; and its GE7FA gas turbine a  ermarket parts subsidiary business, Power Systems Mfg. LLC (PSM), to another company, Ansaldo Energia. [92][93]

 e sale of Alstom's energy division to GE was fi nalised on 2 November 2015; the fi nal valuation being € 12.4 billion, of which € 9.7 billion was transferred to Alstom, the remainder being reinvested in GE/Alstom joint ventures  plus  other  corrections.  e  acquired  businesses  were  reorganised  within  GE's  existing  power generation  business  ( GE  Power  &  Water )  as  GE  Power.  e  remainder  of  Alstom  Group,  including  GE Signalling (acquired via a € 700 million deal), refocused on rail transport. [94][95][96] Due to the acquisition, GE accrued $17.3bn of goodwill, consisting of Alstom's negative book value of $7.2bn at the time of acquisition and the $10.1bn purchase price. In October 2018, GE wrote-o ff $23bn from the value of its power industry division, largely a  ributed to the Alstom purchase. [97]

## November 2015 - present

In November 2015, Alstom was awarded a contract by the Indian Railways to construct an electric locomotive factory in Madhepura (Bihar), receiving an initial order of 800 twin-section 9MW locomotives for use on the Eastern  Dedicated  Freight  Corridor,  valued  at ₹ 190  billion  (about  US$2.9  billion).  is  factory  was  to  be operated under a joint venture with the Ministry of Railways (26%) at a cost of ₹ 13 billion (roughly US$200 million). [98]

In September 2015, it was announced that Amtrak would award Alstom a contract for $2.5 billion for the next generation  high-speed  train  sets  for  the  Northeast  Corridor.  is  would  result  in  the  creation  of  750  jobs across upstate New York with 400 direct manufacturing jobs at Alstom. [99]  e  order for 28 Avelia Liberty trainsets was o ffi cially con fi rmed in August 2016 by Amtrak. [100]  ese trainsets are manufactured at Alstom's plant in Hornell, New York. [101]

In  March  2016,  a  joint  venture  of  Alstom  and  Gibela  began  construction  of  a  new  60,000  square  metres (650,000 sq  ) train building factory in Dunnotar, outside of Johannesburg, South Africa. Initial orders for the factory included 580 X'Trapolis Mega passenger trains for Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa under a € 4 billion contract that was awarded in 2013. [102]

In September 2016, Alstom announced it was to cease locomotive manufacturing at its Belfort (France) site by 2018 due to low orders; remaining production activity was to be transferred to its facility of Alstom DDF in Reichsho ff en,  Alsace. [103] However,  during  October  2016,  the  French  state  placed  an  order  of  about € 650 million for 15 TGV Euroduplex trains; an order for 20 locomotives; plus an order for 30 intercity trains to be built at Reichsho ff en. Together, these orders were su ffi cient to prevent the Belfort plant's closure in the short to medium term. [104][105]

In June 2017, Alstom opened the largest train modernisation facility in the UK at Halebank on the outskirts of Liverpool. Initial work involved the repainting of the Class 390 Pendolino s. [106][107]

On  12  November  2024,  Alstom  announced  on  their  o ffi cial  website  that  the fi rst  of  35  fully  automated metropolis  trains  has  been  delivered  to  Taiwan.  e  four-car  stainless-steel  train  can  carry  up  to  700 passengers, including 108 seated, with speeds up to 100 km/h. [108]

## Attempted merger with Siemens Mobility

On  26  September  2017,  Alstom  announced  a  proposal  to  merge  with  Siemens  Mobility,  the  rolling  stock division  of  German  conglomerate  Siemens;  this  merger  was  promoted  as  the  creation  of  "a  new  European champion in the rail industry". [109]  e  combined rail business, which was to have been reportedly named Siemens Alstom and headquartered in Paris, would have $18 billion U.S. in revenue and employ 62,300 people in  more  than  60  countries. [110] During  November  2018,  the  European  Commission  voiced  its  concerns surrounding the proposed merger of the two companies, particularly that the combined entity would be too dominant  in  the  European  market;  alleged  impacts  from  such  dominance  included  potential  increases  in passenger fares and cargo fees. Furthermore, a series of popular protests concerning the fi nancial reforms of both the French territorial railway infrastructure and SNCF occurred. [111]

 e  proposed  merger  was  viewed  by  some  as  a  measure  to  counter  the  rise  of  rival  Chinese  rail  business CRRC;  it  reportedly  received  support  from  many fi gures  within  both  the  French  and  German governments. [112]  e  transaction,  which  was  originally  due  to  close  by  the  end  of  2018,  was  met  with opposition  by  French  trade  union  o ffi cials  who  voiced  their  concerns  that  such  a  merger  would  have  the potential  for  job  losses. [113] On  17  July  2018,  Alstom  shareholders  overwhelmingly  approved  the  proposed merger with Siemens. [114] On 6 February 2019, the planned merger between the two companies was vetoed by the European Commission. [115] In  response  to  this  ruling,  Alstom's  Chief  Executive  O ffi cer  Henri PoupartLafarge stated that he viewed the decision to block the merger was a result of "ideological prejudices". [116]

## Acquisition of Bombardier Transportation

In mid-February 2020, Alstom announced that it had signed a Memorandum of Agreement to buy Bombardier Transportation, the multinational train maker headquartered in Berlin, Germany for between € 5.8 billion and € 6.2 billion.  e deal required the approval by Alstom shareholders at a meeting to be held in October 2020 and  approval  by  European  regulators.  Bombardier's  major  shareholder,  Caisse  de  dépôt  et  placement  du  ébec, had already agreed to the sale. [117][118]

In July 2020, it was announced that the EU competition authorities had approved the purchase. To fi nish the deal,  Alstom  had  to  sell  the  Alstom  DDF  factory  based  in  France,  a  regional  train  division,  a  Bombardier facility in Germany, and a Bombardier trains division.  e company also had to provide guarantees and pass on some of Bombardier's assets. [119]

## Electric road

Alstom has developed a ground-level power supply (alimentation par le sol - APS) system for use with buses and other vehicles. [120]  e system has been tested for compatibility with snow plows and for safety under exposure to snow, ice, salting, and saturated brine. [121]  e eRoadMontBlanc project is set to trial Alstom's

electric road system on the public road RN205 [122] on  trucks and other vehicles in the Rhône-Alpes region between 2024 and 2027.  is is anticipated to be the fi rst public electric road in France. [123]

## 2024 debt restructuring

Alstom plans in 2024 to issue € 1.75 billion of shares and bonds to reduce its debt, which was at risk of a credit downgrade into junk bond status. [124]

## Transport

Alstom Transport develops and markets a complete range of systems, equipment, and service in the railway industry. [125]  e  division  had  annual  sales  of € 5.5  billion  in  2013. [126] It  is  one  of  the  world's  largest manufacturers of high-speed trains, tramways and metros, electrical and diesel trains, information systems, traction  systems,  power  supply  systems,  and  track  work. [125]  e  company  also  operates  in  the  rail infrastructure market, designing, producing, and installing infrastructure for the rail network.  ese include information  solutions,  electri fi cation,  communication  systems,  track  laying,  station  utilities,  as  well  as workshops and depots. Maintenance, rebuilding, and renovation services are also provided by the company. Alstom Transport operates in 70 countries and employs 26,000 people. [127]

Notable products includes series production of the TGV high-speed trains with over 650 trainsets sold over 25 years, as well as the London Underground 1995 Stock, London Underground 1996 Stock, British Rail Class 390 and AGV. [128]

Since  a  merger  with  General  Railway  Signal  in  1998,  Alstom  has  been  manufacturing  railway  signaling equipment at a former GRS factory located in a suburb near Rochester, New York. A  er the merger with GE signaling the manufacturing was transferred to Missouri, and GRS factory kept engineering the GRS legacy products.

Since 2002, Alstom has manufactured the Pendolino tilting train, following the acquisition of Fiat Ferroviaria.

 e company also produces Citadis trams; in 2007, over 1,100 Citadis trams were in use by 28 cities including Dublin, Algiers, Barcelona, Melbourne, Ro  erdam and Paris. [129]

Between 2007 and 2010, the company produced 1,002 R160A New York City subway cars at its manufacturing plant in Hornell, New York, while the body shells were built at their Lapa plant, in São Paulo, Brazil. In 2013, Alstom  was  awarded  the  contract  to  supply  168  coaches  to  Chennai  Metro  at  a  cost  of ₹ 1,470  crore (US$170 million).  e  company also  owns  the  tender  for  supplying  coaches  to  Kochi  Metro.  In  September 2015,  it  was  announced  in  Hornell,  New  York,  by  Senator  Charles  Schumer  (D-NY)  that  Amtrak  will  be awarding Alstom a contract for $2.45 billion for the next-generation high-speed train sets for the Northeast Corridor.  is would result in the creation of 750 jobs across upstate New York with 400 direct manufacturing jobs at Alstom. [130][131]  e new trainsets will be able to reach speeds up to 186 mph and feature active tilting technology.  e 28 new train sets are scheduled to enter service by 2023. [132]

Next-generation  high-speed  trains  under  development  by  Alstom  are  the  Avelia  family:  ETR  675,  Avelia Horizon and Avelia Liberty.

O  awa  LRT  cars  Alstom  Citadis  Spirit  are  manufactured  in  Hornell,  but  assembly  completed  in  O  awa, Ontario, and Brampton, Ontario.
