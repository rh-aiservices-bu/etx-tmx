      ## 1.1.2. Uncertainties linked to the current economic and political context

      The current economic and political context creates uncertainties on business activities (namely inflation, price volatility of  certain  commodities,  energy,  increases  of  interest  rates,  supply  chain  disruptions  or  electronic  components shortage…). Nevertheless, the Group carefully follows and monitors the potential increase in its cost structures (raw materials prices, supply chain and wages inflation), being quite well protected (71% of the backlog being covered by price escalation clauses on global inflation - commodities, energy and labour indexes).

      Impairment tests have been performed on goodwill, technology and other intangible assets (see Note 11), with no impairment risks identified  as  of  31  March  2023.  Recognition  of  deferred  tax  assets  has  been  assessed  based  on reasonable estimates and on the information available as at March 2023 (see Note 8).

      The  Group  took  into  consideration  the  potential  impacts  due  to  the  specific  context  described  above  in  the  key assumptions as well as in the business plan used for, based on its best reasonable estimates and the visibility available for  its  operations  at  31  March  2023.  Some  enlarged  sensitivity  analyses  were  performed  with  regards  to  the  key assumptions that would not lead to an impairment loss of goodwill as the recoverable amount still exceeds its carrying value.

      ## Measurement of sales and costs

      The  amount  of  revenue  arising  from  a  transaction  is  usually  determined  by  the  contractual  agreement  with  the customer.  IFRS  15  provides  restrictive  guidance  on  the  transaction  price  estimates  and  especially  on  variable consideration and contract modifications.

      The estimation of the transaction price should include variable amounts and/or contract modifications to the extent that it is highly probable that no significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenues recognized will occur when the uncertainty associated with these elements is subsequently resolved. The introduction of this constraint on the price escalation estimates on the one hand, as well as the incorporation of amendments under negotiation on the other hand, leads to recognize these effects on contract value at a later point in time, when they become enforceable.

      In the case of 'construction contracts' claims are considered in the determination of contract revenue only when it is highly probable that the claim will result in additional revenue and the amount can be reliably estimated.

      Penalties are first taken into account as an increase of contract costs and in a second step as a reduction of contract revenue as soon as they are accepted.

      Finally, a significant financial component should be introduced positively or negatively on revenue, when timing of cash receipts and revenue recognition under cost to cost method differ substantially.

      Production costs include direct costs (such as material, labour and warranty costs) and indirect costs. Warranty costs are estimated on the basis of contractual agreement, available statistical data and weighting of all possible outcomes against  their  associated  probabilities.  Warranty  periods  may  extend  up  to  five  years.  Selling  and  administrative expenses are excluded from production costs.
